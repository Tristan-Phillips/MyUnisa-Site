 <br><br><br>The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 108 of 1996 establishes South Africa as a democratic state founded on the values of "non-racialism and non-sexism." Courts have subsequently ruled against "blacks only" organizations as unconstitutional, reflecting a particular interpretation of non-racialism.<br>The prevailing conception of non-racialism in South Africa aligns with what philosopher Theo David Goldberg terms "anti-racialism" rather than "anti-racism" (Goldberg, 2006). This distinction is crucial as:<br>
<br>Anti-racialism promotes the removal of racial categories
<br>Such removal doesn't address historical injustices or dismantle structural privileges
<br>This approach tacitly preserves the status quo established through colonization
<br>It paradoxically positions those seeking racial justice as themselves being "racist"
<br><br>1652 marks the beginning of indigenous South Africans' multi-century liberation struggle against European colonization. The prevailing concept of non-racialism has roots in:<br>
<br>English-speaking settler populations and Cape Liberalism
<br>An unquestioned "right of conquest" philosophy shared with Afrikaner Nationalism
<br><br>The Critical Philosophy of Race demonstrates that racism is philosophically relevant in two interconnected ways:<br>
<br>Western philosophy has been complicit in constructing racist theoretical frameworks
<br>Philosophy can assist in understanding the origins, nature, and workings of racial problems
<br>Philosophy cannot be a passive observer in discussions of racism. Charles Mills (1998) attributes philosophy's reluctance to address racism to what he calls "theoretical whiteness" - a conceptual framework that systematically excludes non-white perspectives, which:<br>
<br>Discourages Black post-graduate students from pursuing academic careers
<br>Allows problematic perspectives to remain unchallenged
<br>Contributes to the underrepresentation of racism's victims in South African academic philosophy
<br>Perpetuates ignorance of African philosophy
<br><br><br>South African educational institutions were founded by European settlers with specific purposes:<br>
<br>Initially to maintain connection with European "civilization and culture"
<br>Cape Colony universities deliberately inculcated English cultural dominance (Phillips, 2003)
<br>They precisely mimicked European universities, even in architectural details
<br>Indigenous peoples were admitted only after conquest and dispossession
<br>Structural poverty forced Africans into the colonizer's employment system
<br>Western education became necessary for economic survival
<br><br>
<br>Provide skilled labor for colonial markets and create consumers
<br>"Civilize" (or "humanize") Africans by imposing European culture, language, religion, and values
<br><br>By 1934, educator Loram noted high dropout and failure rates among indigenous children due to:<br>
<br>Being forced through courses disconnected from their experience
<br>Learning subjects foreign to their lived reality
<br>Being taught in unfamiliar languages
<br>Finding no meaning or satisfaction in their schoolwork
<br><br>South African universities continue to demonstrate bias and condescension toward "non-European" thought, especially African thought and experience, despite:<br>
<br>Abundant scholarship from throughout the continent and African diaspora (Mudimbe 1988, Oyewumi 2007, Adiume 2004)
<br>Notable South African contributions (Magubane 1970, Mafeje 1971, Nolutshungu 1975)
<br><br>Where African perspectives are included, they are typically:<br>
<br>Isolated in "African Studies" or "Indigenous Knowledge Systems"
<br>Treated as specialized subfields rather than integral to core disciplines
<br>Implicitly positioned as non-standard, with non-African subjects treated as universal
<br>Perpetuating doubt about the quality and value of African knowledge
<br>This pattern reinforces universities in Africa rather than truly African universities.<br><br><br>Mabogo More argues that apartheid (formally established 1948) was merely the juridical specification of colonial racism that began in 1652, noting: "the name 'apartheid' emerged as a means of strengthening and perfecting an already existing system of racial discrimination."<br>Two basic colonial traditions have shaped South African philosophy:<br>

 <br>PLS 1501: Introduction to Philosophy (Focus: Race, Philosophy, and South African Context)<br>I. Introduction: The South African Constitution and Non-Racialism<br>
<br>
The 1996 Constitution:  The Republic of South Africa's Constitution (Act 108 of 1996) establishes a democratic state founded on, among other values, "non-racialism and non-sexism." This is a foundational principle aimed at overcoming the legacy of apartheid.

<br>
Non-Racialism vs. Anti-Racism:

<br>Anti-Racialism (Dominant Conception):  This approach, drawing from philosopher Theo David Goldberg, seeks to eliminate racial categories altogether ("racism without races"). The idea is that by removing racial classifications, discrimination will cease.
<br>Critique of Anti-Racialism: The text argues that this approach fails to address the consequences of historical racism.  It doesn't restore lost freedoms, justice, dignity, or equality to victims, nor does it address the unjustly gained privileges of the beneficiaries of racism.  It leaves the structures of inequality intact.
<br>Origins of Anti-Racialism in South Africa:  This conception is linked to Cape Liberalism, originating from English-speaking settler populations.  Like Afrikaner Nationalism, it's argued to be based on an unquestioned "right of conquest" rooted in Western philosophy.
<br>Anti-Racism (Alternative Conception): [ADDED CONTEXT] Anti-racism, in contrast to anti-racialism, actively challenges and dismantles racist structures, policies, and attitudes.  It acknowledges the ongoing reality of race and racism and works to achieve equity.


<br>
The Paradox of Justice:  Victims of historical racism, when pursuing social justice, are often accused of being racist under the anti-racialist framework. This highlights a fundamental tension in the South African context.

<br>
1652: the start of the multi-century war of liberation.

<br>II. The Study of Racism and Philosophy<br>
<br>
Critical Philosophy of Race:  This emerging field argues that racism is a philosophically relevant topic, impacting philosophy in two key ways:

<br>Complicity of (Western) Philosophy:  Western philosophy has historically contributed to the theoretical foundations of racism, either explicitly or implicitly.  This calls for critical self-reflection within the discipline.
<br>Philosophy's Role in Understanding Racism:  Even where philosophy wasn't directly responsible, it has the tools to analyze the origins, nature, and workings of racism, contributing to a deeper understanding of the problem.


<br>
The "Whiteness" of Philosophy (Charles Mills):

<br>Conceptual/Theoretical Whiteness:  Mills argues that philosophy has a "whiteness" that goes beyond the demographics of its practitioners.  It refers to the dominant frameworks, concepts, and perspectives, which often exclude or marginalize non-Western thought.
<br>Self-Sustaining Dynamic: This "whiteness" discourages Black scholars from pursuing philosophy, perpetuating a "monochromatic" character within the discipline.  This leads to a lack of challenge to dominant assumptions.
<br>Under-representation and Ignorance:  The historical victims of racism are underrepresented in academic philosophy in South Africa, and there's a continued ignorance of African philosophy.


<br>III. Racism, the Eurocentric University, and the Marginality of African Philosophy in South Africa<br>
<br>
The Colonial Origins of South African Education:

<br>Mimicking the Metropole: Schools and universities were initially established by European settlers to maintain ties with their "home" countries (e.g., Britain).  Curricula, teaching methods, and even architecture were imported.
<br>Cultural Dominance:  The aim was to instill the cultural dominance of the colonizers (e.g., English cultural dominance in the Cape Colony).
<br>Structural Poverty and Employment:  The dispossession of land and resources forced the indigenous population into a state of structural poverty, compelling them to seek "Western Education" for better employment opportunities.
<br>Dual Function of Education for Colonizers:  Education of Africans served to:

<br>Provide skilled labor for the colonial economy.
<br>Create a new consumer base for European goods.
<br>"Civilize" the supposedly "sub-human" African, imposing European culture, language, religion, and values.




<br>
The Alienation of African Students:  Early educationists (e.g., Loram, 1934) noted the high dropout and failure rates of African children, attributing it to the foreign nature of the curriculum and language of instruction.  This highlights the cultural disconnect and lack of relevance.

<br>
Universities in Africa vs. African Universities:

<br>Eurocentric Bias: South African universities are characterized by a bias against and condescension towards "non-European" thought, particularly African thought and experience.
<br>Ghettoization of African Studies:  African Studies and Indigenous Knowledge Systems are often marginalized and treated as separate, inferior fields, implying that other disciplines are inherently "non-African."
<br>Doubt about African Knowledge:  This marginalization stems from a racist doubt about the humanity of Africans and the validity of their knowledge systems.


<br>
Abundance of African Scholarship: Many scholars in the continent and diaspora.

<br>IV. Some General Characteristics of South African Philosophy<br>
<br>Apartheid as a Juridical Specification of Colonialism:  Mabogo More argues that apartheid (formally instituted in 1948) was a legal codification of a much older system of racist colonialism that began with the arrival of the Dutch in 1652.  The focus on apartheid can obscure the longer history of oppression.
<br>Two Colonial Traditions:  South Africa's colonial history is marked by two main traditions:

<br>Dutch:  Influenced Afrikaner culture, language, and legal systems (Roman-Dutch law).
<br>British:  Influenced English-speaking culture, language, and legal systems (Common law).


<br>These influences are still evident in South African society today.


<br>V. The Afrikaans-Continental Tradition<br>
<br>
Theological Roots:  Institutionalized philosophy in South Africa began in theological schools (e.g., Stellenbosch) in the mid-19th century.

<br>
Influence of Continental Philosophy and Protestant Theology:  Afrikaans universities were heavily influenced by a blend of continental philosophy (especially German idealism) and Protestant theology (Dutch Reformed Church).

<br>
Key Figures and Ideas:

<br>Dr. W.A. Macfayden (University of Pretoria):  Introduced ethics, political science, city planning, and eugenics ‚Äì elements that would later inform apartheid thought.
<br>Calvinist and Neo-Fichtean Tradition (Potchefstroom):  Drew on concepts of nature and the Absolute Spirit to justify racial separation and hierarchy.  Many scholars studied under influential European philosophers.
<br>Phenomenology and Fundamentiele Pedagogie:  Husserlian and Heideggerian phenomenology were misused to justify apartheid's philosophy of education, which aimed to control and shape the minds of young people.
<br>The Broederbond:  A secret Afrikaner society with significant influence in Afrikaans universities, promoting Afrikaner nationalism and controlling education.
<br>Prof. Nico Diederichs:  A prominent Broederbond philosopher and politician who developed a social metaphysics opposed to human equality, arguing for the fulfillment of individuals through the nation.


<br>
Defense of Apartheid:  Most Afrikaans university philosophers explicitly defended apartheid, using various philosophical approaches, including Rawls's Theory of Justice and, most notably, phenomenology.

<br>
Herman de Vleeschauwer: Kant specialist, chair of philosophy at UNISA and Nazi-war crimes convict.

<br>VI. The Anglo-Saxon Tradition<br>
<br>
Origins at the University of the Cape of Good Hope (1873):  Academic philosophy at English-speaking universities began with a focus on liberalism.

<br>
R.F.A. Hoernl√© (University of Cape Town):  A key figure in South African liberalism who advocated for racial separation, not assimilation or parallelism, in a multiracial society.

<br>
"Neutralist Position" of Analytic Philosophers:  Many analytic philosophers claimed to be apolitical, focusing on the logical analysis of concepts rather than engaging with social and political issues.  This is criticized as a form of tacit complicity with the status quo.

<br>
Complicity of "Open Universities":  Teresa Barnes challenges the narrative that English-speaking universities were bastions of resistance against apartheid.  She highlights the involvement of academics in supporting the regime.

<br>
Prof. Andrew Howson Murray (University of Cape Town):

<br>A prominent philosopher and ethics professor who collaborated with the apartheid government.
<br>Advocated for "pluralism" as a justification for racial segregation.
<br>Served as an anti-communist expert witness in the Treason Trial.
<br>Worked for the Publications Appeal Board, censoring books and silencing critical voices.


<br>
Critique of Liberalism:  Liberalism, while often presented as opposing white supremacy, was criticized by some African political movements (e.g., the ANC Youth League) for maintaining the privileges of white supremacy while enjoying a moral reputation for opposing it.

<br>VII. The Contemporary Practice of Philosophy and the Marginality of African Philosophy<br>
<br>Ongoing Struggle:  The text concludes by emphasizing that the struggle for authentic political liberation and economic freedom is ongoing in South Africa. The contestation between "coloured", South African Indian and African people and the struggle against racial injustice is ongoing.
<br>Key Concepts and Themes:<br>
<br>Non-Racialism vs. Anti-Racism: A crucial distinction for understanding the South African context.
<br>Critical Philosophy of Race:  A field challenging the historical and ongoing role of philosophy in relation to racism.
<br>Eurocentrism:  The dominance of European perspectives and knowledge systems in education and academia.
<br>Colonialism and Apartheid:  The historical context shaping South African society and philosophy.
<br>Complicity:  The ways in which individuals and institutions, even those claiming neutrality, can support oppressive systems.
<br>Marginalization:  The exclusion and silencing of African perspectives and knowledge.
<br>Liberation:  The ongoing struggle for freedom, justice, and equality.
<br>Cape Liberalism: a philosophy originating from the English-speaking settlers.

 <br><br>Topic: Racism and Philosophy in South Africa<br><br>
<br>Constitution of South Africa (1996):

<br>Declares South Africa a democratic state founded on values of non-racialism and non-sexism.
<br>Courts have ruled "blacks-only" organizations unconstitutional.


<br>Historical Context:

<br>1652: Indigenous South Africans began a multi-century liberation war against European conquerors.


<br>Non-Racialism vs. Anti-Racism:

<br>Dominant view of non-racialism aligns with anti-racialism (Theo David Goldberg).
<br>Anti-racialism seeks to eliminate racial categories but often leaves systemic injustices intact.
<br>Victims of racism are sometimes accused of racism when pursuing social justice.
<br>Rooted in Cape Liberalism and the "right of conquest."


<br><br>
<br>Critical Philosophy of Race:

<br>Highlights philosophy's complicity in constructing racist ideologies.
<br>Philosophy can analyze the origins, nature, and workings of racism.
<br>Philosophers cannot remain passive in discussions on racism.


<br>Theoretical Whiteness (Charles Mills):

<br>Philosophy's "whiteness" discourages black postgraduate students, perpetuating a monochromatic discipline.
<br>South African universities underrepresent historical victims of racism and neglect African philosophy.


<br><br>
<br>Colonial Foundations of Education:

<br>Schools and universities established to serve European settlers' interests.
<br>Curriculum mimicked European models, dismissing African thought.


<br>Impact on Indigenous People:

<br>Forced into structural poverty and "civilizing" education systems.
<br>Education prioritized creating a skilled labor force and consumers for European goods.


<br>African Scholarship:

<br>Despite rich contributions (e.g., Mudimbe, Oyewumi, Magubane), African philosophy remains marginalized.
<br>Often ghettoized under African Studies or Indigenous Knowledge Systems.
<br>Persistent doubt about African knowledge perpetuates Eurocentric universities.


<br><br>
<br>Apartheid's Historical Context:

<br>Apartheid (1948) formalized pre-existing racial discrimination rooted in 1652 conquest.


<br>Colonial Traditions:

<br>Dutch Tradition: Influenced by Calvinist and Neo-Fichtean philosophy.
<br>British Tradition: Shaped by Anglo-Saxon liberalism.


<br><br>
<br>Origins:

<br>Began in the mid-19th century at Stellenbosch's theological school.

<br>Herman de Vleeschauwer: Kant specialist and Nazi war criminal.


<br>Role in Apartheid:

<br>Phenomenology used to justify apartheid education policies.
<br>Broederbond society controlled education to influence young minds.


<br><br>
<br>Origins:

<br>Began at the University of Cape of Good Hope (1873).
<br>R.F.A. Hoernl√©: Major figure in South African liberalism.


<br>Apartheid Complicity:

<br>Liberalism often justified racial separation (e.g., R.F.A. Hoernl√©'s native policy).
<br>English-speaking universities criticized for supporting apartheid despite claims of resistance.


<br>Andrew Howson Murray (UCT):

<br>Collaborated with the apartheid regime.
<br>Used pluralism as a euphemism for apartheid.
<br>Testified against anti-apartheid activists in the Treason Trial.


<br><br>
<br>Marginality of African Philosophy:

<br>African thought remains underrepresented in South African universities.
<br>Persistent doubt about African knowledge perpetuates Eurocentric dominance.


<br>Ongoing Struggles:

<br>Political and economic liberation remain incomplete.
<br>Challenges persist in addressing historical injustices and systemic racism.


<br>Key Takeaways:<br>
<br>Philosophy in South Africa has been shaped by colonial and apartheid legacies.
<br>Both Dutch and British traditions contributed to the marginalization of African thought.
<br>The neglect of African philosophy reflects broader systemic racism in academia.
<br>Critical engagement with racism and African philosophy is essential for a more inclusive discipline.

<br>1652 -&gt; The year in which the indigenous people (of South Africa) began their multi-century war of liberation against their European conquerors <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=12&amp;annotation=3483R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;annotation=3483R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;annotation=3483R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.12</a><br>
The dominant conception of non-racialism which appears to prevail in South Africa is akin to what philosopher of race Theo David Goldberg has called anti-racialism which is to be distinguished from anti-racism 

(Goldberg, 2006: 257) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=12&amp;annotation=3486R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;annotation=3486R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;annotation=3486R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.12</a>

<br>
Anti-racialism has its ideal effect in critical terms as the prevalence of a racism without races <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=12&amp;annotation=3489R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;annotation=3489R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;annotation=3489R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.12</a>
<br>
In such a situation the categories of race which were used to systematically oppress the indigenous people conquered in the unjust wars of colonization and differentiate them from the conqueror are required to fall away <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=12&amp;selection=160,60,173,4&amp;color=note" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;selection=160,60,173,4&amp;color=note" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;selection=160,60,173,4&amp;color=note" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.12</a>
<br>
The falling away of the categories of race neither subtracts the unjustly gained privilege and power of the beneficiaries of racism nor does it restore freedom, justice, dignity and equality to the victims of racism. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=12&amp;annotation=3492R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;annotation=3492R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;annotation=3492R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.12</a>
<br>
The effect of this approach is ultimately to leave the consequences of a history of injustice undisturbed. This conception of non-racialism very often has left the historical victims of racism without recourse to justice. They are instead under its rule themselves accused of being racist in their pursuit of social justice. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=12&amp;annotation=3495R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;annotation=3495R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;annotation=3495R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.12</a>
<br>
it originates from the English-speaking settler populations and their philosophical tradition of Cape Liberalism <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=12&amp;annotation=3498R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;annotation=3498R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;annotation=3498R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.12</a>
<br>
Much like its more explicitly racist conservative counterpart Afrikaner Nationalism which can be traced to the Dutch settlers who began their wars of the conquest of South Africa in 1652, it also has its basis upon an unquestioned ethically questionable ‚Äúright of conquest‚Äù which has its origin in Western philosophy (Day, 2008, pp. 92-111) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=12&amp;annotation=3501R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;annotation=3501R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&amp;annotation=3501R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.12</a>
<br><br>
A rise in the prominence of what is commonly called the Critical Philosophy of race has to some extent succeeded in making the point that racism is a philosophically relevant subject and has implications for philosophy in at least two main ways which are interrelated.  <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=13&amp;annotation=3504R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&amp;annotation=3504R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&amp;annotation=3504R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.13</a>
<br>
<br>The first is that (Western) philosophy has itself been complicit and continues to be either explicitly or tacitly involved, in the construction of the theoretical edifice of racism and racist thinking. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=13&amp;annotation=3507R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&amp;annotation=3507R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&amp;annotation=3507R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.13</a>
<br>The second way is that even in those places where philosophy has not itself been directly responsible, it nevertheless is competent and able to assist. Where philosophy is unable to assist in the solution of problems of race, it can certainly assist us in the gaining of a better understanding about the origins of the problems, their nature and workings. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=13&amp;annotation=3510R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&amp;annotation=3510R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&amp;annotation=3510R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.13</a>
<br>
Thus there is no provision for philosophy to be a passive spectator in the discourses on racism and the practical implications thereof. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=13&amp;annotation=3513R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&amp;annotation=3513R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&amp;annotation=3513R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.13</a>
<br>
Charles Mills (1998) has suggested that part of the reason for this is ‚Äúthe self-sustaining dynamic of the ‚Äòwhiteness‚Äô of philosophy, not the uncontroversial whiteness of most of its practitioners but what could be called, more contestably, the conceptual or theoretical whiteness of the discipline.‚Äù(Mills, 1998: 2) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=13&amp;annotation=3516R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&amp;annotation=3516R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&amp;annotation=3516R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.13</a>
<br>
He suggests that this theoretical ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù has by itself been enough to discourage black post-graduate students considering a career in the academy which in turn causes certain traits to go either wholly or very weakly challenged so as to maintain the ‚Äúconsistently monochromatic‚Äù character of the discipline (Mills, 1998: 2). <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=13&amp;annotation=3519R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&amp;annotation=3519R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&amp;annotation=3519R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.13</a>
<br>
Much of this has got to do with the general under-representation of the historical victims of racism from academic philosophy in South Africa as well as the continued commitment to ignorance of African philosophy <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=14&amp;annotation=3522R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3522R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3522R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.14</a>
<br><br><br>
The school and university as they currently exist in South Africa were founded by the European settler. Initially the school was to serve the settler‚Äôs immediate personal interest fulfilling the wish to remain intimately connected to ‚Äòthe metropolis‚Äô or ‚Äúsource‚Äù (of civilization and culture). Thus the curriculum and approach to teaching were as consistent with the trends in the original home of the settler as possible. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=14&amp;annotation=3525R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3525R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3525R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.14</a>

Phillips writing of the universities in the Cape Colony suggests that their founding administrators were ‚Äúkeen to inculcate the cultural dominance of English into the new colony‚Äù (Phillips, 2003: 123) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=14&amp;annotation=3528R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3528R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3528R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.14</a>
<br>
The mimesis of the universities in the metropole could be seen, according to Phillips (2003) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=14&amp;annotation=3531R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3531R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3531R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.14</a>

‚Äúthe very architecture of the seating in lecture rooms‚Äù was borrowed from Glasgow and Aberdeen (Phillips, 2003: 126) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=14&amp;annotation=3534R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3534R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3534R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.14</a>
<br>
Later on the indigenous peoples conquered in the unjust wars of colonization were admitted into schools and universities. With the disseizing of the land and its resources which had previously provided for the subsistence of the African, the conquered were thus immediately thrust into a state of severe unnatural but structural, systematic and systemic poverty. In the face of this reality, the logic of survival compelled the conquered to abandon labor as a teleological positing and to enter into the new world of employment established unilaterally by the conqueror (Ramose 2002: 4). <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=14&amp;annotation=3537R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3537R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3537R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.14</a>
<br>
In the world of employment it was apparent that those with the benefit of ‚ÄúWestern Education‚Äù enjoyed better pay and more bearable work, so the older people were forced to recognize the benefits of the education that the missionaries and state over time imposed on Africans. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=14&amp;annotation=3540R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3540R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3540R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.14</a>
<br>
From the side of the colonizer who increasingly recognized the value of and encouraged the education of Africans, it was to serve the dual function of providing the job market with more skilled labor and in turn generate a new population of consumers of the products of Europe and those produced in the local factories. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=14&amp;annotation=3543R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3543R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&amp;annotation=3543R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.14</a>
<br>
The other purpose of education, supposedly an altruistic and humanitarian one was to civilize (humanize) the as yet ‚Äúsub-human African‚Äù by introducing her to the culture, language, religion, values and knowledge of her supposedly superior conqueror <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=15&amp;annotation=3546R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=15&amp;annotation=3546R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=15&amp;annotation=3546R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.15</a>

As long ago as 1934 educationist Loram is quoted trying to explain the high-drop out and failure rates of the children of the indigenous conquered people in the formal education system of South Africa writing that ‚ÄúWe have forced the Native child through a course of study which he can dimly conceive. We have taught him subjects foreign to his experience, and in a language which he cannot understand. At first, he comes to school eager to receive the education which he thinks has made the white man his master. For years [social pressure] causes him to continue [...] and when he wants to know the why and wherefore of things, he sees no meaning in his school work. He finds no satisfaction in doing the tasks given to him [...] no wonder he becomes listless in his school work, fails to satisfy those in authority, and either leaves school or remains there unwillingly" (Cited in McKerron, 1934: 174) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=15&amp;annotation=3549R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=15&amp;annotation=3549R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=15&amp;annotation=3549R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.15</a>

(South African Universities) It has a bias against and condescension towards ‚Äúnon-European‚Äù thought and even more especially against the African thought and experience. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=15&amp;annotation=3552R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=15&amp;annotation=3552R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=15&amp;annotation=3552R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.15</a>

The reality in fact is that there is plenty of such scholarship coming out from all over the continent and throughout the African Diaspora (Mudimbe 1988, Oyewumi 2007, Adiume 2004) and this country specifically (Magubane 1970, Mafeje 1971, Nolutshungu 1975) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=15&amp;annotation=3555R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=15&amp;annotation=3555R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=15&amp;annotation=3555R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.15</a>

16 There are, of course, some exceptions in South Africa but in most cases where Africa is considered at all it is usually ghettoised, under the auspices of African Studies or Indigenous Knowledge Systems <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=16&amp;annotation=3558R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&amp;annotation=3558R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&amp;annotation=3558R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.16</a>

contemporary meaning of ‚Äúghetto‚Äù is ‚Äúa part of the city, especially slum area, occupied by a minority group‚Äù, its original meaning referred to ‚Äúthe quarter of the city, chiefly Italy where Jews were restricted‚Äù. Ghettoising comes to mean then both placement of someone in an inferior and precarious place subtracting from equal citizenship as well as an ethnic quarantine where those ghettoised are identified for particular ethnic or racial reasons. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=16&amp;annotation=3561R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&amp;annotation=3561R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&amp;annotation=3561R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.16</a>

American is silently prefixed against other disciplines or studies, its existence in Africa suggests precisely that all else, that is, those disciplines which are not specifically pre-fixed with ‚ÄúAfrican‚Äù are not African. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=16&amp;annotation=3564R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&amp;annotation=3564R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&amp;annotation=3564R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.16</a>

The reason for the foregoing is the persistence of doubt concerning the reality or quality of African knowledge and the importance and value of the experience which brings it about. It is a doubt which has its philosophical foundation in the racist doubt concerning the humanity of Africans themselves. In the academe it is largely the reason for which we continue merely to have universities in Africa rather than African universities. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=16&amp;annotation=3567R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&amp;annotation=3567R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&amp;annotation=3567R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.16</a>

In an article entitled Philosophy in South Africa Under and After Apartheid, Mabogo More argues that apartheid was merely the name of a juridical specification of a long existent, violent and racist colonialism which properly started in 1652 with the arrival of the Dutch. Apartheid as such then has limited historical significance and is often used in obfuscatory manner to distort the length of time over which liberation has been outstanding and to deflect attention from the conquest of indigenous people in the unjust wars of colonization <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=16&amp;annotation=3570R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&amp;annotation=3570R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&amp;annotation=3570R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.16</a>

More writes ‚Äúthe name ‚Äòapartheid‚Äô emerged- in its legal sense- in 1948 as a means of strengthening and perfecting an already existing system of racial discrimination and domination rooted in attitudes of whites ever since they came into contact with the African‚Äù <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=16&amp;annotation=3573R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&amp;annotation=3573R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&amp;annotation=3573R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.16</a>
<br>There have been two basic traditions of colonialism in South Africa
the Dutch and the British <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=16&amp;annotation=3576R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&amp;annotation=3576R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&amp;annotation=3576R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.16</a><br>

The beginnings of institutionalized philosophy in South Africa were at the theological school in Stellenbosch in the mid-19th century <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=17&amp;annotation=3582R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&amp;annotation=3582R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&amp;annotation=3582R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.17</a>

Several Afrikaans universities were then formed in the Orange Free State, Pretoria and Potchefstroom. Amongst early notables were Dr WA Macfayden who began teaching ethics and political science at the University of Pretoria in 1911 and was appointed as Professor of philosophy and political science the following year where he taught until his death in 1924. Amongst the assortment of offerings he introduced during his tenure were essentials of later apartheid thought such as city planning and eugenics. (Duvenhage, 2008:110) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=17&amp;annotation=3585R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&amp;annotation=3585R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&amp;annotation=3585R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.17</a>

According to Duvenhage, what one sees in a study of the development of institutionalized philosophy at the Afrikaans universities during the 20th century, for instance at Stellenbosch, is the influence ‚Äúof a certain blend of continental philosophy and Protestant theology (influenced by the powerful Dutch Reformed Church). This is evident, for example, in the works of Kirsten, Degenaar and Rossouw. He suggests that even in Pretoria the trend was the same but observes that the Pretorians Rautenbach, Oberholzer and Dreyer were more conservative. (Duvenhage, 2008:112) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=17&amp;annotation=3588R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&amp;annotation=3588R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&amp;annotation=3588R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.17</a>
<br>
According to More (2004), there developed from the religious and cultural traditions of the Afrikaner people- a certain distinct Calvinist and Neo-Fichtean tradition especially at Potchefstroom. Many of the advocates of this philosophy studied in Europe under philosophers such as Schelling, Herder or Fichte and were under the influence of mostly Dutch and German philosophers (More 2004: 151) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=17&amp;annotation=3591R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&amp;annotation=3591R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&amp;annotation=3591R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.17</a>
<br>
From Fichte the concept of nature was invoked to justify the maintenance of separation between groups of different languages as well as his view of the individual sub-ordinate aspect of the Absolute Spirit which reveals itself historically in the life of the community <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=17&amp;annotation=3594R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&amp;annotation=3594R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&amp;annotation=3594R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.17</a>

Once apartheid had commenced (after 1948) most Afrikaans university philosophers explicitly defended it. A variety of approaches were employed towards this end including Rawls‚Äôs Theory of Justice (More 2004: p.153). <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=17&amp;annotation=3597R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&amp;annotation=3597R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&amp;annotation=3597R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.17</a>

It was, however, Husserlian and Heideggerian phenomenology which were put to greatest misuse. Phenomenology, for instance, was the basis of the apartheid state‚Äôs philosophy of education Fundamentiele Pedagogie (Fundamental Pedagogy) the development of which was headed by the Afrikaans University of Potchefstroom for Christian Higher Education (ibidem) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=18&amp;annotation=3600R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=18&amp;annotation=3600R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=18&amp;annotation=3600R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.18</a>

Writing of the Afrikaner secret society known as Broederbond in 1978, political journalists Ivor Wilkins and Hans Strydom (2012: 14-15) state that: ‚ÄúThe Broederbond has an abiding passion for control of education because of the obvious advantages this holds for any organization wishing to influence the minds and lives of young people. Consequently its representation in the top echelons of all the Afrikaans speaking universities is extremely strong.‚Äù <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=18&amp;annotation=3603R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=18&amp;annotation=3603R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=18&amp;annotation=3603R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.18</a>

Prof Nico Diederichs was by far the most famous broeder philosopher, going on to become the first vice-chancellor of the Rand Afrikaans Universiteit (later the University of Johannesburg) and Finance Minister before becoming State President of South Africa in 1975. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=18&amp;annotation=3606R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=18&amp;annotation=3606R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=18&amp;annotation=3606R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.18</a>

Before his rise to academic administration and politics, Nico Diederichs had been chair of political philosophy at the University of the Orange Free State and had studied in both Holland and Germany (Moodie, 1975: 154), had made many politically relevant contributions in his academic career. He had, for example, theorized a social metaphysics opposed to human equality in his Nasionalisme as Lewesbeskouing en sy Verhouding tot Internationalisme (Nationalism as a Weltenshaaung and Its Relation to Internationalism) (Moodie, 1975: 154). <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=18&amp;annotation=3609R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=18&amp;annotation=3609R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=18&amp;annotation=3609R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.18</a>

At the University of South Africa as well there was Herman de Vleeschauwer a Kant specialist who was Chair of the Philosophy Department from 1951 through to 1965. A professor who was an escaped convict for Nazi-war crimes committed during the German occupation of Belgium during the Second World War.

One of the first philosophers to occupy the chair of philosophy at the South African College (later the University of Cape Town {UCT}) was R.F.A. Hoernl√©.

‚Äúboth the Anglo-Saxon and Continental traditions may have been used to provide justification for racial and cultural discrimination before official apartheid in 1948 and during apartheid in the years that followed‚Äù. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=20&amp;annotation=3633R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3633R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3633R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.20</a>

The analytic philosophers took what has been described by some as a ‚Äúneutralist position.‚Äù (More 2004:154) The proponents of this position held that philosophy ought to be pursued for its own sake without involving itself in social and political issues of its day.  <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=20&amp;annotation=3636R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3636R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3636R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.20</a>

More summarizes their argument as follows ‚Äúsince according to [them] philosophy is a second-order activity concerned mainly with the logical analysis of concepts, the task of the philosopher is therefore the clarification of the logic of concepts and their meaning. Social and political issues are not accordingly the task of the philosopher qua philosopher but qua active citizen.‚Äù (More, 2004: 154)  <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=20&amp;annotation=3639R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3639R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3639R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.20</a>

Teresa Barnes writes about how the English speaking universities have, as with most individual politicians and activists, been over-celebrated for their ‚Äústruggle‚Äù and ‚Äúresistance‚Äù against apartheid. This mostly through the slanted discussion of their quest for academic freedom and students they produced who became antiapartheid activists. She makes the focus of her paper an examination of the extent to which the English-speaking or so-called ‚Äòopen universities‚Äô were complicit in the sustenance and support for apartheid in South Africa. Dealing in particular with the case of UCT‚Äôs philosophy department, some interesting details about that university‚Äôs departmental history emerge which contradict the idea that philosophers ‚ÄúStayed Out of Politics‚Äù to use Aronson‚Äôs phrase (1990). <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=20&amp;annotation=3642R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3642R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3642R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.20</a>

Professor Andrew Howson Murray, who held the chair of UCT‚Äôs department of philosophy and ethics from 1937-1970 was a well-known and widely employed collaborator and agent of the apartheid regime. In the course of his academic work Murray, for instance, contributed chapters to volumes published in honour of two conservative South African philosophers the Belgian ex-Nazi fugitive Herman de Vleeschauwer of Unisa and Stoker of the University of Potchefstroom (Barnes, 2015: 21) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=20&amp;annotation=3645R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3645R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3645R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.20</a>
<br>
Barnes writes ‚ÄúAs a philosopher and educator, Murray‚Äôs perspective was that the concept of pluralism was the only answer to the challenges of life in a multi-racial society. Although in other settings pluralism can be a reasonable call for democratic decentralization, in Murray‚Äôs hands it was deformed into an apology for apartheid‚Äù (Barnes, 2015: 22).  <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=20&amp;annotation=3648R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3648R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3648R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.20</a>

Barnes draws on a variety of his writings as well as of his students‚Äô marked copies of examination papers to support her reading that for Murray pluralism became a ‚Äúeuphemistic legitimation for injustice‚Äù(Barnes, 2015: 23). <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=20&amp;annotation=3651R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3651R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3651R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.20</a>

It is arguable but one might suggest that an Ethics professor‚Äôs most significant work can happen outside of the classroom. Murray appeared as the state‚Äôs anti-communist expert in the Treason Trial where he was ‚Äúbrought in as a state witness by the pro-Nazi, chief prosecutor Oswald Pirow‚Äù (Barnes, 2015: 24).Murray‚Äôs main task as expert witness was to identify the accused‚Äôs writings as ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=20&amp;annotation=3654R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3654R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&amp;annotation=3654R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.20</a>
<br>
The defense famously successfully had him unknowingly analyze his own earlier writings which he classified as communist (Barnes, 2015: 24). According to Barnes, Murray continued to testify against anti-apartheid activists well into the 1980s. Murray also worked for the Publications Appeal Board (the main South African censorship body from the 1960s until the 1980s). (Barnes, 2015: 25) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=21&amp;annotation=3657R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=21&amp;annotation=3657R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=21&amp;annotation=3657R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.21</a>

According to Barnes, ‚ÄúMurray was the head of the political committee of the Board and wrote many opinions that were central in the Board‚Äôs decisions to ban books and silence authors of critical political materials‚Äù (Barnes, 2015: 25).

Soc. Then, Laches, suppose that we first set about determining the nature of courage, and in the second place proceed to enquire how the young men may attain this quality by the help of studies and pursuits. Tell me, if you can, what is courage?
<br>
La. Indeed, Socrates, I see no difficulty in answering; he is a man of courage who does not run away, but remains at his post and fights against the enemy; there can be no mistake about that.
<br>
Soc. Very good, Laches; and yet I fear that I did not express myself clearly; and therefore you have answered not the question which I intended to ask, but another.
<br>
La. What do you mean, Socrates? 
<br>
Soc. I will endeavour to explain; you would call a man courageous who remains at his post, and fights with the enemy? 
<br>
La. Certainly I should. 
<br>
Soc. And so should I; but what would you say of another man, who fights flying, instead of remaining? 
<br>
La. How flying? 
<br>
Soc. Why, as the Scythians are said to fight, flying as well as pursuing; and as Homer says in praise of the horses of Aeneas, that they knew ‚Äúhow to pursue, and fly quickly hither and thither''; and he passes an encomium on Aeneas himself, as having a knowledge of fear or flight, and calls him ‚Äúan author of fear or flight''. 
<br>
La. Yes, Socrates, and there Homer is right: for he was speaking of chariots, as you were speaking of the Scythian cavalry, who have that way of fighting; but the heavyarmed Greek fights, as I say, remaining in his rank. 
<br>
Soc. And yet, Laches, you must except the Lacedaemonians at Plataea, who, when they came upon the light shields of the Persians, are said not to have been willing to stand and fight, and to have fled; but when the ranks of the Persians were broken, they turned upon them like cavalry, and won the battle of Plataea. 
<br>
La. That is true. 
<br>
Soc. That was my meaning when I said that I was to blame in having put my question badly, and that this was the reason of your answering badly. For I meant to ask you not only about the courage of heavy-armed soldiers, but about the courage of cavalry and every other style of soldier; and not only who are courageous in war, but who are courageous in perils by sea, and who in disease, or in poverty, or again in politics, are courageous; and not only who are courageous against pain or fear, but mighty to contend against desires and pleasures, either fixed in their rank or turning upon their enemy. There is this sort of courage-is there not, Laches? 
<br>
La. Certainly, Socrates. 
<br>
Soc. And all these are courageous, but some have courage in pleasures, and some in pains: some in desires, and some in fears, and some are cowards under the same conditions, as I should imagine. 
<br>
La. Very true. 
<br>
Soc. Now I was asking about courage and cowardice in general. And I will begin with courage, and once more ask: What is that common quality, which is the same in all these cases, and which is called courage? Do you now understand what I mean? 
<br>
La. Not over well. 
<br>
Soc. I mean this: As I might ask what is that quality which is called quickness, and which is found in running, in playing the lyre, in speaking, in learning, and in many other similar actions, or rather which we possess in nearly every action that is worth mentioning of arms, legs, mouth, voice, mind - would you not apply the term quickness to all of them?
<br>
La. Quite true. 
<br>
Soc. And suppose I were to be asked by some one: What is that common quality, Socrates, which, in all these uses of the word, you call quickness? I should say the quality which accomplishes much in a little time whether in running, speaking, or in any other sort of action. 
<br>
La. You would be quite correct. 
<br>
Soc. And now, Laches, do you try and tell me in like manner, What is that common quality which is called courage, and which includes all the various uses of the term when applied both to pleasure and pain, and in all the cases to which I was just now referring? 
<br>
La. I should say that courage is a sort of endurance of the soul, if I am to speak of the universal nature which pervades them all. 
<br>
Soc. But that is what we must do if we are to answer the question. And yet I cannot say that every kind of endurance is, in my opinion, to be deemed courage. Hear my reason: I am sure, Laches, that you would consider courage to be a very noble quality. 
<br>
La. Most noble, certainly. 
<br>
Soc. And you would say that a wise endurance is also good and noble? 
<br>
La. Very noble. 
<br>
Soc. But what would you say of a foolish endurance? Is not that, on the other hand, to be regarded as evil and hurtful? 
<br>
La. True. 
<br>
Soc. And is anything noble which is evil and hurtful? 
<br>
La. I ought not to say that, Socrates. 
<br>
Soc. Then you would not admit that sort of endurance to be courage ¬± for it is not noble, but courage is noble? 
<br>
La. You are right. 
<br>
Soc. Then, according to you, only the wise endurance is courage? 
<br>
La. True. 
<br>
Soc. But as to the epithet "wise" ¬± wise in what? In all things small as well as great? For example, if a man shows the quality of endurance in spending his money wisely, knowing that by spending he will acquire more in the end, do you call him courageous? 
<br>
La. Assuredly not.
<br>
Soc. Or, for example, if a man is a physician, and his son, or some patient of his, has inflammation of the lungs, and begs that he may be allowed to eat or drink something, and the other is firm and refuses; is that courage? 
<br>
La. No; that is not courage at all, any more than the last. 
<br>
Soc. Again, take the case of one who endures in war, and is willing to fight, and wisely calculates and knows that others will help him, and that there will be fewer and inferior men against him than there are with him; and suppose that he has also advantages of position; would you say of such a one who endures with all this wisdom and preparation, that he, or some man in the opposing army who is in the opposite circumstances to these and yet endures and remains at his post, is the braver? 
<br>
La. I should say that the latter, Socrates, was the braver. 
<br>
Soc. But, surely, this is a foolish endurance in comparison with the other? 
<br>
La. That is true. 
<br>
Soc. Then you would say that he who in an engagement of cavalry endures, having the knowledge of horsemanship, is not so courageous as he who endures, having no such knowledge? 
<br>
La. So I should say. 
<br>
Soc. And he who endures, having a knowledge of the use of the sling, or the bow, or of any other art, is not so courageous as he who endures, not having such a knowledge? 
<br>
La. True. 
<br>
Soc. And he who descends into a well, and dives, and holds out in this or any similar action, having no knowledge of diving, or the like, is, as you would say, more courageous than those who have this knowledge? 
<br>
La. Why, Socrates, what else can a man say? 
<br>
Soc. Nothing, if that be what he thinks.

 <br><br><br>Philosophy, from the Greek philein ("to love") and sophia ("wisdom"), literally means "love of wisdom." Far from being the disconnected intellectual pursuit sometimes caricatured in modern times, philosophy represents humanity's fundamental quest to understand reality, knowledge, and ourselves.<br>The study of ancient philosophy provides essential context for understanding how human thought has evolved over time. Philosophers, while often revolutionary thinkers, were nonetheless constrained by the worldviews of their historical periods, making the contextualization of their ideas crucial for proper understanding.<br><br><br>The first Western philosophers emerged in Miletus, an Ionian coastal city, in the 6th century BCE. Unlike their mythological predecessors, these thinkers sought explanations based on rational principles rather than divine intervention.<br>The Milesian philosophers‚ÄîThales (c.625-545 BCE), Anaximander (c.611-545 BCE), and Anaximenes (c.585-525 BCE)‚Äîwere united in their search for the arche, the first governing principle that transforms chaos into cosmos.<br>Thales proposed that water was the fundamental substance of all things. His reasoning included observations that:<br>
<br>Earth appears to float on water
<br>Spring water gushes from the earth
<br>Water can transform: evaporation (water to air), condensation (air to water)
<br>Water takes on fiery appearance in volcanic activity
<br>Anaximander criticized Thales, arguing that since water is quantitatively exhaustible, it couldn't be the ultimate arche. Instead, he proposed the apeiron (the unlimited or indefinite), an eternal, boundless substance containing all elements in an unmixed state. Strikingly, Anaximander hypothesized the existence of multiple worlds arising from and returning to this apeiron.<br>Anaximenes proposed that air was the fundamental substance, with all other substances formed through condensation and rarefaction. His theory provided a single natural mechanism to explain all physical change:<br>
<br>Compressed air becomes cold, then water, then earth and stones
<br>Rarefied air becomes hot, then fire
<br>This analysis of all physical phenomena as functions of a single quantitative process represents the culmination of Milesian thought.<br><br>Heraclitus (c.540-470 BCE) rejected the search for underlying unity in favor of eternal flux. His famous saying, "One cannot step into the same river twice," expressed his belief that everything constantly changes. Fire, perpetually renewing itself, symbolized this universal principle of change. <br>Heraclitus identified an unchanging principle he called the logos, which paradoxically states that everything changes. The logos dictates that all things pass into their opposites or are constituted by the tension between opposites.<br>His disciple Cratylus took this theory to its logical extreme, concluding that even language was unstable since both words and their meanings constantly change. This led him to reject verbal communication entirely.<br>Parmenides (c.540-480 BCE) took the opposite position, arguing that change itself is an illusion. His logical argument proceeded:<br>
<br>For true change to occur, something must come into being that was not previously
<br>But this is impossible because:

<br>If it comes from something else, it already existed
<br>If it comes from nothing, then "nothing" would need some kind of existence


<br>Therefore, Being is one, uncreated, indestructible, and unchanging
<br>For Parmenides, pure reason reveals that Being is identical with itself, cannot be divided, and cannot change. Therefore, all variety, multiplicity, and movement must be mere appearance rather than reality.<br><br>The Sophists were 5th century BCE professional educators who emphasized persuasion rather than knowledge. They shifted philosophical interest from natural phenomena to human conduct and relationships.<br>The Sophistic position on knowledge was fundamentally relativistic, arguing that there is no objective truth‚Äîonly subjective opinion. The individual becomes "the measure of all things" in matters of knowledge.<br>The Sophists pointed to contradictions in earlier philosophical theories to support their skepticism:<br>
<br>If there is no change (Parmenides), knowledge is impossible because description implies difference
<br>If everything changes (Heraclitus), knowledge is equally impossible because nothing persists to be known
<br>If knowledge comes only through the senses, the true nature of things remains elusive
<br>This skeptical stance anticipated aspects of postmodern philosophy, which similarly questions universal truths and objective meaning.<br><br>We know of Socrates (c.470-399 BCE) primarily through Plato's dialogues. Socrates employed a distinctive method of philosophical inquiry characterized by systematic questioning in search of defensible definitions. Key features of the Socratic method include:<br>
<br>Seeking essential definitions rather than mere examples
<br>Rejecting circular definitions (those containing the term to be defined)
<br>Testing proposed definitions through deductive reasoning
<br>Identifying contradictions or conflicts with established facts
<br>The Socratic method aims to expose inadequate understanding and stimulate deeper thought through productive frustration. Unlike the Sophists, Socrates believed in objective truth that could be discovered through rigorous examination of concepts.<br>Socrates connected epistemology (knowledge) with ethics, arguing that knowledge is virtue (arete). For the ancient Greeks, arete referred to excellence in performing one's function‚Äîbeing good at something. The virtuous person, according to Socrates, was skilled at living well as a human being.<br><br>Plato (c.427-347 BCE) developed a comprehensive philosophical system to resolve the tension between Heraclitus's flux and Parmenides's permanence. His core theory posits two realms:<br>
<br>The material world of sense perception‚Äîcharacterized by change, imperfection, and becoming
<br>The immaterial world of Forms (or Ideas)‚Äîcharacterized by permanence, perfection, and being
<br><br>Plato distinguished sharply between:<br>
<br>Knowledge: Certain, permanent, and accessible only through rational intuition
<br>Opinion: Uncertain, changeable, and derived from sense perception
<br>For Plato, the objects of knowledge must be unchanging and universal. Since the material world constantly changes, it can only be the object of opinion, not knowledge. True knowledge pertains to the Forms, which are permanent, perfect archetypes of everything in the material world.<br><br>The Forms are not mere mental concepts but objective realities existing independently of our minds. Examples include:<br>
<br>The Form of Beauty (perfect beauty)
<br>The Form of Justice (perfect justice)
<br>The Form of Circle (perfect circularity)
<br>Material objects participate in or "imitate" these Forms imperfectly. For instance, no physical circle perfectly embodies the Form of Circle, yet all circles approximate it.<br><br>To explain how humans can access knowledge of the Forms, Plato proposed that learning is actually recollection. His theory includes these elements:<br>
<br>The soul existed before birth in the realm of Forms, where it had direct knowledge of them
<br>Upon entering a physical body, the soul "forgets" this knowledge
<br>Sensory experiences can trigger remembrance of the Forms
<br>The "flash of recognition" accompanying new understanding is actually recollection of what the soul once knew
<br>This theory depends on a dualistic view of human nature, with the immortal soul belonging to the world of Forms while temporarily imprisoned in a material body.<br><br>In his famous allegory, Plato compares ordinary humans to prisoners in a cave who mistake shadows for reality. The philosopher is like a freed prisoner who ascends to see the real world outside the cave. Initially blinded by the sun (representing the Form of the Good), the philosopher gradually adjusts and gains true knowledge.<br>Upon returning to the cave, the philosopher appears confused to those who know only shadows, yet possesses genuine wisdom that the others lack.<br><br>
<br>Knowledge is permanent and not subject to correction
<br>Sense perception cannot provide knowledge, only true belief
<br>Forms are eternal and unchanging, making them proper objects of knowledge
<br>Forms are apprehended by the mind, not the senses
<br>Knowledge depends on the mind's capacity for recollection of the Forms
<br><br>Additional Context (Not in Original Text): <br>Plato's theory of Forms has had profound influence on Western thought, particularly through its impact on Christian theology. The Neo-Platonists later developed these ideas further, emphasizing the transcendent Form of the Good as analogous to God. <br>The epistemological problems Plato addressed‚Äîhow we can have certain knowledge in a changing world‚Äîremain central to contemporary philosophy. His student Aristotle would later develop an alternative approach focusing on the formal and material aspects of particular things rather than transcendent Forms, setting the stage for scientific empiricism.<br>These ancient philosophical debates about knowledge, reality, and human nature are not merely historical artifacts but continue to shape how we understand the psychological dimensions of human cognition, perception, and reasoning.<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Knowledge must be true - one cannot know what is false
<br>Mental states can only be considered "knowing" to the extent they participate in truth
<br>Truth consists in the degree to which particular things conform to their archetypes in the realm of Forms
<br>Knowledge fundamentally involves perceiving this conformity between particulars and Forms
<br><br>
<br>Modern thinkers often contrast knowledge with belief
<br>For Plato, knowledge is an individual intellectual state or act of recognizing truth
<br>Knowledge is entirely "inside the head" - material world contains only the contingent, deceptive appearances of knowledge
<br>True knowledge comes from reason, not sensory experience
<br><br>
<br>Forms exist as perfect, immutable archetypes of all things
<br>Particular objects in the material world participate in these Forms
<br>Forms are more real than their material instances
<br>Knowledge involves recognizing the Forms through rational contemplation
<br><br>
<br>
The Relationship Problem: How are Forms related to one another and to the particular things that exemplify them?

<br>
The Participation Problem: How exactly do material things "participate" in Forms?

<br>
The Third Man Argument (Aristotle's criticism): 

<br>If the Form of Man is what all men resemble, is it just another man?
<br>If not, how can men resemble it?
<br>This creates an infinite regress: If a man resembles the Form of Man, we need another Form to explain the resemblance, and so on


<br>
The Problem of Relational Terms:

<br>Terms like "tall," "short," etc. have no absolute meaning
<br>They require comparison to have meaning
<br>There can't be a Form of "tallness" since the same object would be both "tall" and "short" depending on comparison


<br>
The Problem of Universals:

<br>Plato's realist approach treats classes as objects of knowledge independent of particulars
<br>This creates difficulty explaining how both universals and particulars can be legitimate objects of knowledge


<br><br><br><br>
<br>We perceive the world through our senses, recognizing that perceptions are partial representations of reality
<br>Reason must be used to discover the unchanging essence of what we perceive
<br>Knowledge is organized hierarchically:

<br>Contingent knowledge (undifferentiated and changing)
<br>Universal knowledge or genus (qualities shared by groups)
<br>Essential knowledge or species (unique specific qualities)


<br>Essential properties can be discovered through the four causes
<br><br>
<br>Forms and particulars are interdependent; neither can exist without the other
<br>Knowledge is not innate or recollected but acquired with the help of sense perception
<br>Sense perception plays an essential role: "the act of sense perception is of the particular but its content is Universal"
<br><br>
<br>Forms exist in a classification scheme where each has a defined place
<br>Species are contained within genera
<br>Species are distinguished by unique, essential characteristics
<br>Knowledge is only possible of Forms, not of particulars, because particulars cannot be defined
<br><br>
<br>Induction: Generalizing from observation of particulars
<br>Establishing causal connections: Converting plain facts to reasoned facts
<br>Nous (intuition): A superior form of apprehension that reveals causes directly
<br>Deduction: Further scientific knowledge reached through logical deduction
<br><br>
<br>Aristotle was a realist who believed Forms have objective existence
<br>Forms cannot exist independently of particulars - they are interdependent
<br>Knowledge is gained with help from sense perception, not recollection
<br>Forms possess necessary attributes that define them
<br>Intuition (nous) reveals causes and reasoned facts
<br>Scientific knowledge is based on reasoned facts and extended through deduction
<br>Empirical inquiry can yield knowledge as certain as mathematical knowledge
<br><br>
<br>Aristotle accepted that knowledge connects to truth, belief, and justification
<br>Truth is "to say of what is, that it is, or of what is not, that it is not"
<br>Justification requires extensive observation and careful investigation
<br><br><br>
<br>
Material Cause: The stuff of which something is composed

<br>Example for tire: rubber with chemical additives, steel wire reinforcing, steel rim


<br>
Formal Cause: The shape, pattern, composition, or structure

<br>Example for tire: circular pattern, about 20cm deep, with textured surface


<br>
Efficient/Motive Cause: The initiator of the process that brings something into being

<br>Example for tire: produced by melting and molding rubber


<br>
Final Cause: The goal or end for which something occurs

<br>Example for tire: aimed at producing a safe, smooth car/road interface


<br><br><br>
<br>Knowledge is ordinary and accessible to all who observe the world carefully
<br>Not a mystical communion restricted to exceptional individuals (contra Plato)
<br><br>
<br>Everything is knowable except things that happen by accident (not determined by causal laws)
<br>Chance events are not knowable because they don't follow causal laws
<br><br>
<br>Ordinary physical objects like tables and cats are the objects of knowledge
<br>No hierarchy of being with Forms at the top (unlike Plato)
<br>Form and matter never exist separately
<br><br>
<br>Matter is potentiality; form is actualized matter
<br>All things are involved in processes of change
<br>Each thing possesses power to develop toward its "end" (entelechy)
<br>Self-contained end of anything is its entelechy
<br><br>
<br>Not the first mover or creator in theological sense
<br>The "reason for" or "principle of" motion
<br>Acts as final cause and thereby as efficient cause through attraction
<br>Makes the world an intelligible order by inspiring striving toward natural ends
<br><br>
<br>
We can question whether reason is an infallible guide to causes of events

<br>
Different kinds of knowledge might be justified in different ways:

<br>Mathematical knowledge (deductive)
<br>Empirical knowledge (observational)


<br>
Classification systems are useful scientific tools but may involve contingent associations rather than necessary ones

<br>
Modern scientists side with Hume against Aristotle on whether scientific laws embody logically necessary truths

<br><br><br>(Additional context: Both philosophers conceived knowledge as involving necessary relations between events, and both believed proper methods could lead to certain knowledge. This contrasts with later epistemological developments, especially after Hume's critiques of causality and necessary connections.)<br><br><br>Philosophy, derived from Greek philein ("to love") and sophia ("wisdom"), literally means "love of wisdom." While contemporary philosophy has evolved significantly from its ancient origins, understanding the historical development of philosophical thought is essential for comprehending modern philosophical concepts and methods.<br><br>Philosophy is fundamentally a rational justification of our intuitive perceptions about existence‚Äîthe what, how, and why of reality. Unlike the stereotypical image of philosophy as a detached intellectual pursuit, true philosophical inquiry emerges from everyday experiences and questions about reality. Key characteristics of philosophical inquiry include:<br>
<br>Continuous debate and self-criticism
<br>Development through dialogue and discussion
<br>Provisional definition of concepts followed by critical examination
<br>Advancement through disagreement and refinement of ideas
<br>Philosophy doesn't simply provide answers; it develops methods to question assumptions, examine implications, and create coherent frameworks for understanding reality.<br><br><br>
<br>Mind is dominated by sense impressions
<br>Anthropomorphic interpretation of natural phenomena
<br>Uncritical acceptance of sensory testimony
<br>Attempt to establish cosmic order through mythical narratives
<br><br>The first philosophers emerged when thinking shifted from mythological explanations to rational inquiry. This shift was characterized by:<br>
<br>Critical examination of sense impressions
<br>Search for consistent explanations of phenomena
<br>Rejection of anthropomorphic interpretations of nature
<br>Development of logical reasoning as methodology
<br>This transition occurred in the 6th century BCE, particularly in Miletus (Ionian coast), driven partly by economic and material needs as Greek society shifted from agricultural to maritime lifestyles.<br><br>The Pre-Socratics were preoccupied with identifying the first governing principle of the world‚Äîthe arche‚Äîthat transforms chaos into cosmos. They challenged the prevailing mythological view of four basic elements (Air, Earth, Fire, Water), seeking instead a single fundamental element or principle.<br><br><br>
<br>Proposed Water as the fundamental element
<br>Reasoning included: earth appears to rest on water; water can transform into other elements; all living things require moisture
<br>First to seek naturalistic rather than mythological explanations
<br><br>
<br>Criticized Thales' view that water was the arche
<br>Proposed the apeiron (the unlimited/indefinite) as the arche
<br>Claimed there are unlimited numbers of worlds arising from and returning to the apeiron
<br>Objected that water is quantitatively exhaustible and thus cannot be the fundamental principle
<br><br>
<br>Proposed Air as the fundamental element
<br>Introduced the mechanism of condensation-rarefaction to explain transformations
<br>When compressed, air becomes water and eventually earth/stones; when rarefied, it becomes fire
<br>Created a unified explanatory system of physical change through a single mechanism
<br><br><br>
<br>Rejected the search for an underlying unity
<br>Claimed everything is in constant flux: "One cannot step into the same river twice"
<br>Identified Fire as symbolic of perpetual change
<br>Introduced the concept of logos‚Äîthe universal principle that everything changes
<br>Proposed unity of opposites in constant tension
<br>His disciple Cratylus took this to the extreme, concluding that:<br>
<br>If everything constantly changes, even words and their meanings change
<br>Communication becomes impossible
<br>We cannot step into the same river even once
<br>Knowledge is impossible if objects constantly change
<br><br>
<br>Opposed Heraclitus by claiming change is an illusion
<br>Argued change is logically impossible:

<br>If something comes into being, it must come either from something or nothing
<br>If from something, it already existed; if from nothing, that's impossible
<br>Therefore, change is illusory


<br>Concluded that being is one, uncreated, indestructible, and unchanging
<br>Established "The Way of Truth" through pure logical reasoning
<br>Used strict logical analysis to show contradictions in everyday language about change
<br><br>The Sophists were 5th century BCE professional educators who shifted philosophical focus from natural philosophy to human conduct and relationships:<br>
<br>Emphasized persuasion rather than knowledge
<br>Argued that philosophy revealed no consensus among philosophers
<br>Concluded there is no objective truth‚Äîonly subjective opinion
<br>Adopted philosophical relativism and skepticism
<br>Compared by Bertrand Russell to modern corporate lawyers
<br><br>Our understanding of Socrates comes primarily through Plato's dialogues, where Socrates appears as the main character. Socrates developed a distinctive method of philosophical inquiry:<br><br>
<br>Systematic questioning aimed at finding precise definitions of concepts
<br>Search for the essential nature of things rather than examples
<br>Examination of provisional definitions through logical analysis
<br>Rejection of circular reasoning and inadequate definitions
<br>Testing of definitions through deduction to reveal contradictions
<br>This method aims to reveal the limitations in our understanding and move toward more precise definitions through:<br>
<br>Starting with provisional definitions based on common understanding
<br>Testing these definitions for logical consistency
<br>Identifying contradictions or counter-examples
<br>Refining definitions based on these insights
<br>Socrates claimed to "know that he did not know" (Socratic ignorance), distinguishing his approach from the Sophists' skepticism by seeking clarification rather than merely demonstrating argumentative skill.<br><br>Plato attempted to resolve the impasse between Parmenides' unchanging reality and Heraclitus' constant flux by proposing a dual-realm theory of reality.<br><br><br>
<br>The physical world we perceive through senses is constantly changing and therefore not fully real
<br>True knowledge requires unchanging objects of knowledge
<br>These unchanging objects are Forms (or Ideas)‚Äîperfect, eternal patterns that exist independently of physical objects
<br>Physical objects participate in or imitate Forms, but never perfectly embody them
<br>Forms exist in their own realm, separate from the physical world
<br><br>
<br>Eternal and unchanging
<br>Perfect exemplars of qualities (e.g., perfect Beauty, Justice, Circle)
<br>Not accessible through sense perception but through rational intuition
<br>Hierarchically arranged with the Form of the Good at the summit
<br>More real than physical objects, which are mere shadows of Forms
<br><br><br>
<br>Knowledge (episteme) is of what is real and unchanging (Forms)
<br>Opinion (doxa) is of the changing physical world
<br>Knowledge is certain; opinion is provisional and subject to error
<br><br>
<br>The soul existed before birth in the realm of Forms
<br>Learning is recollection of knowledge the soul possessed before birth
<br>Sensory encounters with imperfect physical objects can trigger recollection of Forms
<br>True knowledge requires overcoming bodily distractions through philosophical training
<br><br>
<br>Illusion (eikasia) - shadows, reflections
<br>Belief (pistis) - physical objects
<br>Thought (dianoia) - mathematical reasoning
<br>Understanding (noesis) - direct apprehension of Forms
<br><br>Plato established a fundamental dualism between:<br>
<br>Body (physical, changing, mortal) and Soul (immaterial, unchanging, immortal)
<br>Appearance (physical world) and Reality (world of Forms)
<br>Opinion and Knowledge
<br><br>
<br>The "Third Man Argument" - If the Form of Man is what all men resemble, is it just another man? If so, we need another Form to explain this relation, leading to infinite regress.
<br>The problem of participation - How exactly do physical objects "participate in" Forms?
<br>The problem of relational qualities - Can there be Forms of relational terms like "tall" or "small" which have meaning only in comparison?
<br><br>Aristotle, Plato's student, developed a more empirically-grounded philosophy while maintaining many of his teacher's concerns.<br><br><br>
<br>Forms do not exist independently of particulars; they are interdependent
<br>Knowledge is not innate recollection but developed through observation and reasoning
<br>Sense perception plays an essential role in acquiring knowledge
<br>Classification and categorization are central to knowledge acquisition
<br><br>
<br>Species (lowest level) - defined by essential properties
<br>Genus (higher level) - containing multiple species
<br>Knowledge is of universals (Forms), not particulars
<br>Particulars can be described and identified but not defined
<br><br>
<br>Observation provides "plain facts" (properties that regularly appear together)
<br>Induction enables generalization from particulars to universals
<br>Causal connections establish necessity and reveal "reasoned facts"
<br>Intuition (nous) allows direct apprehension of causes and principles
<br><br>Aristotle identified four different kinds of causes that explain why things are as they are:<br>
<br>
Material Cause: The matter from which something is made

<br>Example: The bronze of a statue


<br>
Formal Cause: The pattern, shape, or structure that gives something its form

<br>Example: The shape of the statue


<br>
Efficient Cause: The agent that brings something into being

<br>Example: The sculptor who made the statue


<br>
Final Cause: The purpose or goal for which something exists

<br>Example: The purpose for which the statue was created


<br><br><br>
<br>Individual substances are the primary realities
<br>Each substance is a combination of matter and form
<br>Matter is potentiality; form is actuality
<br>Change occurs when potentiality becomes actuality
<br><br>
<br>Things have inherent potential to become what their form determines
<br>Each thing strives toward its natural end (telos)
<br>The self-contained end of anything is its entelechy
<br>Movement/change is the actualization of potential
<br><br>
<br>The eternal principle of motion and order in the universe
<br>Pure actuality with no potentiality
<br>Causes motion as an object of desire/final cause rather than efficient cause
<br>Makes the world an intelligible order through the power of attraction
<br><br>
<br>Assumption that reason is an infallible guide to causes
<br>Belief that scientific laws embody logically necessary truth
<br>Classification schemes may reflect convenience rather than necessity
<br>Modern science rejects the notion that physical causes create logically necessary connections
<br><br><br><br>The debates between these ancient philosophers established fundamental questions that continue to shape philosophical inquiry:<br>
<br>The relationship between appearance and reality
<br>The possibility and nature of objective knowledge
<br>The role of reason versus sense experience
<br>The status of universals (Forms/categories)
<br>The nature of causality
<br>The relationship between knowledge and ethics
<br><br>Note added for context: While not explicitly discussed in the original text, it's important to recognize that the Pre-Socratics' search for natural explanations marked a crucial shift from mythological thinking to rational inquiry that forms the basis of modern scientific thought. Their questioning of fundamental principles established the pattern for systematic philosophical inquiry that continues today.]]></description><link>.\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\myNotes\studyUnit\u2\autoNotes\PLS1501-ME-SU2-AutoNotes-CLAUDESONNET.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">90180/firstlevel/pls1501/myNotes/studyUnit/u2/autoNotes/PLS1501-ME-SU2-AutoNotes-CLAUDESONNET.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[TRAP]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 09:00:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[PLS1501-ME-SU2-AutoNotes-GEMINIPRO]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>PLS1501: Introduction to Philosophy ‚Äì Unit: The Pre-Socratics, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle<br>I. Introduction: The Nature of Philosophical Inquiry<br>
<br>The Caricature of the Philosopher:  The text begins by addressing a common, outdated stereotype of the philosopher as an isolated, detached academic. It emphasizes the shift towards a more holistic view of thinking, incorporating perception and feeling ("perfink" ‚Äì Bruner, 1986).
<br>Historical Context:  Philosophers, even revolutionary ones, are products of their time. Understanding their historical context is crucial for interpreting their ideas.  This includes understanding prevailing worldviews and how they shaped philosophical questions.

<br>Example:  Julian Jaynes' (1990) theory of the bicameral mind suggests that ancient people might have literally "heard the voice of God" due to a different structure of consciousness.


<br>Key Concepts:

<br>Epistemology: The study of knowledge, truth, belief, and justification.  It asks: How do we know what we know? What is the nature of truth?
<br>Metaphysics: The study of fundamental reality, including questions about existence, substance, cause, and effect. It asks: What is the nature of being? What is ultimately real?


<br>Learning outcome: explain why we need to understand the history of philosophy before we can understand what philosophy is
<br>II. What is Philosophy?<br>
<br>Provisional Definition: Philosophy is the rational justification of our intuitive perceptions about the what, how, and why of existence.
<br>Philosophical Method: A continuous process of:

<br>Provisional Definition: Starting with a common-sense understanding of a concept.
<br>Analysis and Critique: Examining the definition, exploring its implications, and identifying inconsistencies.
<br>Revision and Refinement: Modifying the definition based on the critique, leading to a new theory.
<br>Dialogue and Debate:  The history of philosophy is a continuous discussion, with issues remaining relevant to contemporary thought.


<br>Knowledge as Evolutionary: Philosophical knowledge isn't strictly "true" or "false," but rather more or less biologically and evolutionarily useful.  This highlights the pragmatic aspect of philosophical inquiry.
<br>Philosophy as a "Love of Wisdom": Derived from the Greek philein (to love) and sophia (wisdom).
<br>III. Philosophy and the History of Philosophy<br>
<br>Interdependence:  Modern philosophy is deeply rooted in the work of previous philosophers.  To understand contemporary thought, we must understand its historical development.
<br>Rethinking Past Theories:  We don't just study past theories; we must actively engage with them, redeveloping them in our own thinking to generate new ideas.
<br>Example: pre-17th-century reliance on authority over observation.
<br>Learning outcome: give an account of the Arche as found in the concepts of the Milesian philosophers identify the various relevant features of pre-Socratic thought that constitute the philosophical background to Socrates's approach to philosophy
<br>IV. The Beginnings of Philosophical Thinking in Greece<br>
<br>From Myth to Philosophy:  Greek philosophy emerged as a departure from mythological explanations of the world.  This transition involved a shift from accepting sensory impressions uncritically to seeking rational explanations.
<br>Mythological Thought:

<br>Characterized by anthropomorphic interpretations of natural phenomena.
<br>Homeric mythology was a central part of Greek culture and public worship.
<br>Sought to establish order but relied on uncritical acceptance of sensory experience.


<br>The Milesian School (6th Century BCE):  Generally considered the starting point of Greek philosophy.

<br>Location: Miletus, on the Ionian coast.
<br>Key Figures: Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes.
<br>Economic Context:  The shift from an agricultural to a maritime lifestyle in Miletus likely contributed to the interest in understanding natural patterns.


<br>The Quest for the Arche (First Cause): The Milesians were preoccupied with identifying the fundamental principle or substance underlying the cosmos.

<br>Monism: The belief that a single element is more fundamental than others. This contrasts with the traditional view of four elements (air, earth, fire, water).


<br>V. Pre-Socratic Philosophers: The Quest for the Arche<br>
<br>Thales (c. 625-545 BCE):

<br>Arche: Water.
<br>Reasoning:  Observed that water appears to be essential to life and can transform into other states (evaporation, rain, etc.).  Also considered the geological relationship between water and earth.


<br>Anaximander (c. 611-545 BCE):

<br>Arche: The apeiron (the unlimited or indefinite).
<br>Reasoning:  Criticized Thales' view, arguing that water is quantitatively exhaustible.  The apeiron is an inexhaustible, unmixed source from which all things arise and to which they return. He proposed the existence of multiple cosmos.


<br>Anaximenes (c. 585-525 BCE):

<br>Arche: Air.
<br>Mechanism: Condensation and rarefaction.
<br>Reasoning:  Observed that air can change its density and appearance (e.g., breath being cold when compressed, hot when relaxed).  This provided a single, quantitative process to explain all physical changes.


<br>Feedback: The pre-socratics focused on understanding the natural world and searched for the most simple form for which to explain it.
<br>Other Significant Pre-Socratics:

<br>Heraclitus (c. 540-470 BCE):

<br>Central Idea:  Constant change ("One cannot step into the same river twice").
<br>Arche: Fire (symbolizing the constant process of transformation).
<br>Logos: The unchanging principle of change itself.  The logos states that all things are constituted by the union of opposites, a tension driving them towards transformation.
<br>Cratylus (disciple):  Took Heraclitus's ideas to their extreme, arguing that constant change undermines the possibility of stable meaning and communication.


<br>Parmenides (c. 540-480 BCE):

<br>Central Idea: Change is an illusion.  True being is one, uncreated, and indestructible.
<br>Reasoning:  Used a strict logical argument:  Something cannot come from nothing, and "what is" cannot become "what is not."  Therefore, true change is impossible.
<br>The Way of Truth vs. The Way of Belief:  Distinguished between the rational understanding of being (The Way of Truth) and the illusory world of appearances (The Way of Belief).




<br>Feedback: The monist position, although revised, was upheld through the Pre-Socratic era.
<br>VI. The Sophists (5th Century BCE)<br>
<br>Professional Educators:  Focused on rhetoric and persuasion rather than the pursuit of absolute truth.  Compared to modern corporate lawyers (Bertrand Russell).
<br>Shift in Focus: From explaining nature to explaining human conduct and relationships.
<br>Key Ideas:

<br>Relativism:  There is no objective truth, only subjective opinion.
<br>Skepticism:  The riddle of the universe is unsolvable.
<br>Emphasis on Persuasion:  The goal of argument is to win, not to discover truth.


<br>Modern Relevance:  Postmodern philosophers often adopt a Sophist-like stance, emphasizing the contingency and contextuality of knowledge.
<br>Quote (Caputo, 1993):  Highlights the fragility of life and the absence of overarching meaning in events.
<br>VII. Socrates (c. 470-399 BCE)<br>
<br>No Written Records:  Our knowledge of Socrates comes primarily from Plato's dialogues.
<br>The Socratic Method:  A systematic questioning process aimed at arriving at a defensible definition of a concept.

<br>Goal: To uncover the essential nature of something.
<br>Argument of Negativity:  Rejecting definitions based on mere examples or circular reasoning.
<br>Testing by Reasoning:  Using the proposed definition as a premise in an argument and examining the consequences for contradictions or conflicts with observed facts.


<br>Example: The Dialogue with Laches:  Demonstrates the Socratic method in action, exploring the definition of courage.
<br>Philosophical Scope:  Socrates expanded philosophical inquiry to include ethics, politics, and epistemology, in addition to metaphysics.
<br>Feedback: Both were teachers of philosophy but differed in their approach to knowledge.
<br>VIII. Plato (c. 428-348 BCE)<br>
<br>Central Belief:  The world we perceive through our senses is not fully real; it is a world of change and decay.  There must be a world of stable, perfect objects (Forms) behind the changing appearances.
<br>Theory of Knowledge (Epistemology):

<br>Knowledge is Virtue (Ar√™te):  Ar√™te refers to excellence or performing one's function well.  Human ar√™te is being good at being human.
<br>Knowledge is Necessary Truth:  Only what is necessarily true and beyond doubt can be considered knowledge.  Contingent truths are matters of opinion or belief.
<br>Rational Intuition:  Knowledge is accessed through the "mind's eye," not through sensory perception.
<br>The Role of the Senses:  The senses can mislead and distort our judgment, hindering the pursuit of knowledge.
<br>The Soul and Thinking:  Wisdom is achieved through pure thinking, the soul's special activity.  The philosopher seeks to purify the soul from bodily contamination.
<br>Mathematics as an Example:  Mathematical concepts (unity, line, circle) are abstract and not perfectly realized in the material world, suggesting the existence of a realm of pure Forms.


<br>Theory of Forms (Universals):

<br>Distinction: Knowledge (of the real) vs. Opinion (of what seems to be).
<br>Being, Nonbeing, and Becoming:  The object of opinion is a combination of being and nonbeing, called Becoming.
<br>Characteristics of Forms:  Unchanging, absolute, universal.
<br>Examples:  Beauty, Justice, Goodness, Horse, Mountain, etc.
<br>Realist View:  Forms exist independently of our minds.  Objects in the sensory world participate imperfectly in the Forms.


<br>The Allegory of the Cave:  Illustrates the journey from ignorance (the cave) to knowledge (the world of Forms). The journey out of the cave is difficult.
<br>Doctrine of Anamnesis (Recollection):

<br>Dualism:  The soul is immaterial and distinct from the body.
<br>Immortality of the Soul:  The soul pre-exists the body and returns to the world of Forms after death.
<br>Forgetfulness and Recollection:  The soul forgets the Forms when it enters the body.  Sensory experience can trigger a recollection of the Forms.


<br>Summary of Plato's Theory of Knowledge:

<br>Knowledge is permanent and certain.
<br>Knowledge cannot be based on sense perception.
<br>True belief can guide the mind to remember the Forms.
<br>Forms are eternal and changeless, thus objects of knowledge.
<br>Forms are accessed through the mind, not the senses.
<br>Knowledge is acquired through the mind's capacity for recollection.


<br>Feedback: Platos theory of knowledge claims recollection is how humans can access the Forms.
<br>IX. Key Questions and Reflections (Points to Ponder and Feedback)<br>
<br>Why did the problem of the arche arise among the ancient Greeks?  The changing lifestyle and increasing reliance on natural patterns likely prompted the search for underlying principles.
<br>How did Pre-Socratic dialogue advance the philosophical quest?  Each philosopher built upon or critiqued the ideas of their predecessors, leading to a more refined understanding of the fundamental nature of reality.
<br>How does Socrates's claim to ignorance differ from the Sophists'?  Socrates sought intellectual clarity as an end in itself, while the Sophists focused on rhetorical skill and persuasion.
<br>Why did Plato think virtue depends on knowledge? Only if one knows the good can one do the good.
<br>Does Platos allegory of the cave explain how we come to have knowledge of the Forms? No, the allegory only demonstrates the effects of having knowledge of the Forms.
<br>Do we need to suppose the existence of Forms and the pre-existence of the mind to explain mathematical knowledge?  No, mathematical knowledge can be explained by understanding the meanings of terms and drawing deductive conclusions from axioms, which may be derived from experience.
<br>This expanded set of notes provides a more in-depth and contextualized understanding of the material, suitable for a psychology student. It clarifies key concepts, highlights the progression of ideas, and emphasizes the connections between philosophy and other disciplines.<br><br>Psychology:  Ancient Greek Epistemology and Metaphysics (Plato &amp; Aristotle)<br>I. Plato's Theory of Knowledge (Epistemology)<br>
<br>
Core Concept:  Knowledge as Justified True Belief (JTB) - A Precursor

<br>Plato doesn't explicitly use the phrase "justified true belief," but his ideas form the foundation for this later, crucial concept in epistemology.
<br>Knowledge Requires Truth: For Plato, a claim to knowledge must be true.  If something isn't true, it cannot be known.  This establishes a fundamental link between knowledge and truth.
<br>Mental States and Truth:  A mental state (a belief) can only be considered "knowledge" if it accurately reflects the truth.  The degree to which a belief aligns with truth determines its status as knowledge.
<br>The Role of Reason: Knowledge, for Plato, is primarily an intellectual state, achieved through reason.  It's an internal recognition of truth, not merely a perception of the external world. The external world, for Plato, is full of deceptive appearances.


<br>
The Theory of Forms:

<br>The Realm of Forms:  Plato posits a realm of perfect, unchanging archetypes called "Forms" (e.g., the Form of Beauty, the Form of Justice, the Form of a Table).  These Forms are the true objects of knowledge.
<br>Particulars and Participation:  The physical objects we perceive in the world (e.g., a beautiful sunset, a just act, a specific table) are imperfect copies or "participations" in the Forms.  They resemble the Forms but are not the Forms themselves.
<br>Knowledge as Recollection (Anamnesis):  (Added Context) Plato believed that the soul existed in the realm of Forms before birth and had direct knowledge of them.  Learning, therefore, is not acquiring new information but remembering what the soul already knows. This is tied to his belief in the immortality of the soul.
<br>Knowledge as Conformity:  True knowledge involves perceiving how closely a particular thing (an object, an idea, an action) conforms to its corresponding Form. The closer the resemblance, the closer we are to true knowledge.


<br>
Criticisms of Plato's Theory (Internal and External):

<br>The Relationship Problem:  Plato himself recognized the difficulty in explaining precisely how Forms relate to particular things.  How does a physical object "participate" in an abstract Form?
<br>The Third Man Argument (Aristotle's Criticism):  If a man is a man because he resembles the Form of Man, then isn't the Form of Man itself just another man?  This leads to an infinite regress ‚Äì needing a Form to explain the resemblance between particulars and the first Form, and so on.
<br>Relational Qualities:  Terms like "tall" or "short" are relative.  There cannot be a single Form of Tallness, as something can be tall compared to one thing and short compared to another. This poses a challenge to the idea that all concepts have corresponding Forms.
<br>The Problem of Universals: (Realism vs. other views) How are we to know universals before particulars.


<br>II. Aristotle's Epistemology and Metaphysics<br>
<br>
A Shift from Forms to Particulars:

<br>Rejection of Independent Forms:  Unlike Plato, Aristotle believed that Forms do not exist independently of particular things.  Form and matter are interdependent; one cannot exist without the other.
<br>Empiricism (Emphasis on Observation):  Aristotle placed significant importance on sense perception as a crucial part of acquiring knowledge.  While Plato emphasized reason almost exclusively, Aristotle saw observation of the physical world as essential.
<br>Knowledge Through Abstraction:  We gain knowledge of universals (Forms) through our experience of particulars. We observe many individual instances and, through reason, abstract the common, essential properties.


<br>
Aristotle's Classificatory Scheme:

<br>Hierarchy of Forms:  Aristotle organized knowledge into a hierarchy:

<br>Contingent:  The lowest level, characterized by undifferentiated and changing things (e.g., individual plants).
<br>Genus:  A broader category sharing common qualities (e.g., trees).
<br>Species:  The most specific level, defined by unique and essential characteristics (e.g., oak trees, distinguished by acorns).


<br>Definition vs. Description:  Only Forms (species and genera) can be defined by their essential properties.  Particulars can only be described, as they lack essential properties that make them that specific individual.


<br>
Induction and Deduction:

<br>Induction:  The process of generalizing from specific observations to broader principles.  We observe many instances of a phenomenon and, through reason, identify the underlying cause or essential property.
<br>Deduction:  Once we have established essential properties (through induction), we can use deductive reasoning to derive further knowledge.  This is similar to how we derive theorems in geometry from basic axioms.
<br>Plain Fact vs. Reasoned Fact:  Observation reveals the "plain fact" (that something is the case).  Reason, through induction and the identification of causes, transforms this into a "reasoned fact" (why something is the case).


<br>
Nous (Intuition):

<br>The Source of Certainty:  Aristotle believed that nous, a kind of intuitive understanding, is how we recognize the truth of reasoned facts.  It's a direct apprehension of truth, even more reliable than deduced knowledge.

<br>(Added Context): This concept is somewhat problematic, as it seems to rely on a kind of "inner knowing" that is difficult to explain or verify.




<br>
Aristotle's Metaphysics (The Nature of Reality):

<br>The Four Causes:  Aristotle's explanation of why things are the way they are, and how they change.

<br>Material Cause:  The matter or substance something is made of (e.g., the wood of a table).
<br>Formal Cause:  The shape, structure, or arrangement of the matter (e.g., the design of a table).
<br>Efficient Cause:  The agent or force that brings something into being (e.g., the carpenter who builds the table).
<br>Final Cause:  The purpose or end goal of something (e.g., the table's purpose is to provide a surface for eating or working).


<br>Potentiality and Actuality:

<br>Potentiality:  The inherent capacity of something to become something else (e.g., an acorn has the potential to become an oak tree).  Matter is potentiality.
<br>Actuality:  The realization of that potential (e.g., the fully grown oak tree).  Form is actualized matter.
<br>Entelechy:  The inherent drive or purpose within a thing that directs it towards its full actualization.


<br>The Unmoved Mover:

<br>The Ultimate Cause of Motion:  Aristotle posited an "Unmoved Mover" as the ultimate source of all motion and change in the universe.  It is pure actuality, with no potentiality, and it moves other things by attracting them towards itself (as a final cause).
<br>(Added Context):  The Unmoved Mover is not a creator god in the Judeo-Christian sense.  It's a philosophical concept to explain the continuous motion and change in the universe. It is found within the world.




<br>
Truth, Belief, and Justification:

Aristotle, in a well-known passage of his Metaphysics writes that ‚Äúto speak the truth is simply to say of what is, that it is, or of what is not, that it is not; and to speak falsely is to say of what is, that it is not, or of what is not, that it is''.
Aristotle also pays close attention to justification. He emphasizes the need for extensive and careful observation, and places a high value on the tireless investigation of scientific matters, an investigation which, in principle, might be never-ending since new evidence is always coming to light.


<br>
Critical Observations of Aristotle:

<br>The Infallibility of Reason:  Is reason truly an infallible guide to discovering the causes of events? Can we be certain that observed associations are necessary associations?
<br>The Limits of Deduction:  While deduction is powerful, it relies on the accuracy of the initial premises (the essential properties).  How can we be sure these premises are correct?
<br>The Problem of Induction:  (Added Context - Hume's Problem):  How can we justify generalizing from a finite number of observations to a universal claim?  Just because something has happened a certain way in the past doesn't guarantee it will happen that way in the future. This is a major challenge to Aristotelian empiricism.

<br>These notes provide a comprehensive overview of Plato and Aristotle's views on knowledge and reality, setting the stage for further exploration of epistemology and metaphysics in your psychology studies. They also emphasize the crucial differences and lasting influence of these two foundational thinkers. Remember to consult additional sources and engage in critical thinking to deepen your understanding.<br><br>PLS1501:  Introduction to Philosophy ‚Äì  Ancient Greek Philosophy (Pre-Socratics, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle)<br>I.  Introduction:  The Nature and History of Philosophy<br>
<br>
The Caricature of the Philosopher:  The text begins by addressing the outdated stereotype of the philosopher as an isolated, abstract thinker, disconnected from the real world.  It emphasizes the shift towards a more integrated view of thinking ("perfink" - perceiving, feeling, and thinking simultaneously).

<br>
Philosophy as a Historical Dialogue:  Philosophy isn't a static body of knowledge but a continuous, evolving conversation.  Understanding its history is crucial to understanding contemporary philosophical thought. Philosophers are "trapped within her particular historical period's world view".

<br>
Key Terms:

<br>Epistemology:  The study of knowledge, truth, belief, and justification.  What can we know, and how can we know it?
<br>Metaphysics:  The study of fundamental reality, substance, and causality.  What is the nature of existence?


<br>
Provisional Definition of philosophy: Philosophy is the rational justification of our intuitive perceptions about the what, the how and the why of existence

<br>
The Philosophical Method:  Philosophy progresses through a cyclical process:

<br>Provisional Definition:  Start with a common-sense understanding of a concept.
<br>Examination and Critique:  Analyze the definition, explore its implications, and identify inconsistencies.
<br>Refinement:  Modify the definition based on the critique, leading to a new theory.
<br>Further Critique:  The new theory is then subjected to further scrutiny, leading to ongoing debate and advancement.


<br>
The Importance of Historical Context:  To understand philosophical ideas, we must understand their origins and the historical context in which they arose.  This includes rethinking past theories and developing new ones.

<br>II.  The Pre-Socratics:  The Quest for the Arche<br>
<br>
Shift from Myth to Logos:  The Pre-Socratics (6th century BCE) represent a crucial transition from mythological explanations of the world to rational, naturalistic ones. They moved away from anthropomorphic gods and sought underlying principles.

<br>
The Milesian School (Ionian School):  Focused on identifying the arche (the fundamental principle or substance of the universe).  This represents early attempts at monism (reducing the many to the one).

<br>Thales:  Proposed that water is the arche.  He observed water's various states (solid, liquid, gas) and its apparent connection to life.
<br>Anaximander:  Argued for the apeiron (the unlimited or boundless) as the arche.  He believed the arche must be something more fundamental than any specific element, something inexhaustible.
<br>Anaximenes:  Suggested air as the arche, and proposed the mechanism of condensation-rarefaction to explain change.  Air, through compression, becomes water, then earth; through rarefaction, it becomes fire.


<br>
The Problem of Change and Permanence:  The Pre-Socratics grappled with the apparent conflict between the constant change observed in the world and the need for a stable, underlying reality.

<br>
Heraclitus:  Emphasized constant change ("You cannot step into the same river twice").  He saw fire as symbolic of this ever-changing nature and identified the logos (reason, principle) as the underlying order governing change, specifically the principle that all things pass into their opposites.

<br>Cratylus (Heraclitus's disciple):  Took the idea of change to its extreme, arguing that even language is unstable, making meaningful communication impossible.  This highlights the assumption that knowledge requires unchanging truth.


<br>
Parmenides:  Argued that change is an illusion.  He used a strictly logical argument:  Something cannot come from nothing, so "coming into being" implies pre-existence.  Therefore, Being is one, uncreated, and indestructible.  He distinguished between "The Way of Truth" (reason) and "The Way of Belief" (sensory experience).

<br>
ADDED CONTEXT: The Eleatic School: Parmenides is considered the founder of the Eleatic school, which emphasized the unchanging nature of reality. His student, Zeno of Elea, is famous for his paradoxes (e.g., Achilles and the tortoise) that aimed to demonstrate the impossibility of motion.

<br>III.  The Sophists:  Relativism and Persuasion<br>
<br>
Shift from Cosmology to Human Affairs:  The Sophists (5th century BCE) were professional educators who focused on rhetoric and persuasion, particularly in legal and political contexts.  They represent a shift from explaining nature to explaining human conduct.

<br>
Relativism:  The Sophists argued that there is no objective truth, only subjective opinion.  "Man is the measure of all things" (Protagoras).  They emphasized the power of persuasion over the pursuit of knowledge.

<br>
ADDED CONTEXT: Implications for Ethics:  Sophistic relativism had significant implications for ethics.  If there are no objective moral truths, then morality becomes a matter of convention or individual preference.

<br>
Postmodern Parallels: The text notes that some postmodern philosophers share a similar relativistic viewpoint, emphasizing the lack of overarching meaning in events.

<br>IV.  Socrates:  The Socratic Method and the Pursuit of Definitions<br>
<br>
No Writings:  We know Socrates primarily through the writings of his student, Plato.

<br>
The Socratic Method:  A form of inquiry based on systematic questioning to arrive at a defensible definition of a concept (e.g., justice, courage, piety).  The goal is to identify the essence of something, its defining characteristics.

<br>Argument of Negativity:  Socrates would challenge proposed definitions by showing their inconsistencies, circularity, or failure to capture the essence of the concept.
<br>Example: Laches Dialogue:  The text refers to a dialogue between Socrates and Laches on the definition of courage, illustrating the Socratic method's iterative and challenging nature.


<br>
Epistemological and Ethical Concerns:  Socrates expanded the scope of philosophical inquiry to include not only epistemology and metaphysics but also ethics and political philosophy.

<br>V.  Plato:  The Theory of Forms and the Divided Line<br>
<br>
Resolving the Problem of Change:  Plato sought to reconcile the insights of Heraclitus (change) and Parmenides (permanence) by proposing a dualistic view of reality.

<br>
The Theory of Forms:  The core of Plato's philosophy.  He argued that the physical world we perceive through our senses is only a shadow or imperfect copy of a higher realm of Forms (or Universals).

<br>Characteristics of Forms:  Eternal, unchanging, perfect, objective, and accessible only through reason (not sense perception).  Examples include Justice, Beauty, Goodness, and even physical objects like "Horse" or "Mountain."
<br>Participation:  Physical objects "participate" in the Forms, meaning they imperfectly embody the Forms' essence.
<br>Realism:  Plato was a realist about Forms, believing they exist independently of our minds.


<br>
Knowledge vs. Opinion:  Plato distinguished between knowledge (of the Forms) and opinion (of the changing physical world).  Knowledge is certain and true, while opinion is fallible and subject to change.

<br>
The Allegory of the Cave:  A famous metaphor illustrating Plato's theory.  Prisoners chained in a cave see only shadows on the wall, mistaking them for reality.  One prisoner escapes and sees the true world (the Forms) illuminated by the sun (the Good).  This represents the philosopher's journey from ignorance to knowledge.

<br>
Anamnesis (Recollection):  Plato believed that the soul is immortal and has pre-birth knowledge of the Forms.  Learning is a process of recollecting this forgotten knowledge, triggered by sensory experiences. This explains the "flash of recognition" when we grasp a new concept.

<br>
Dualism:  Plato's view of the soul and body as distinct substances is a form of dualism. The soul is superior to the body and belongs to the world of Forms.

<br>
Knowledge, Truth, Belief, and Justification (Plato):

<br>Knowledge requires truth.  Something must be true to be known.
<br>Truth is tied to the Forms.  The degree to which something conforms to its corresponding Form determines its truth.
<br>Knowledge is an internal, intellectual act of recognizing truth.


<br>
Criticisms of Plato's Theory:

<br>The Third Man Argument:  If particulars resemble the Form of Man, doesn't that require another Form to explain the resemblance, leading to an infinite regress?
<br>Relational Qualities:  How can there be Forms for relational qualities like "tall" or "short," which depend on comparison?
<br>Participation:  The concept of "participation" remains unclear.


<br>VI.  Aristotle:  Empiricism, Causation, and the Unmoved Mover<br>
<br>
Rejection of Separate Forms:  Aristotle, Plato's student, disagreed with the idea of Forms existing independently of particulars.  He believed Forms and particulars are interdependent.

<br>
Empiricism:  Aristotle emphasized the importance of sense perception in acquiring knowledge.  "The act of sense perception is of the particular but its content is Universal."

<br>
Classification and Definition:  Aristotle developed a hierarchical system of classification, moving from species (lowest Form) to genus (higher Form).  Definitions identify the essential characteristics of a species within its genus.

<br>Induction:  The process of generalizing from observations of particulars to identify essential properties.


<br>
Plain Fact vs. Reasoned Fact:  Aristotle distinguished between observing a fact (plain fact) and understanding its cause (reasoned fact).  Knowledge requires understanding the why.

<br>
Nous (Intuition):  Aristotle believed that nous (intuition) allows us to grasp the causes of events and achieve true understanding.

<br>
Knowledge, Truth, Belief, and Justification (Aristotle):

<br>Knowledge is still connected to truth, belief, and justification.
<br>Truth is defined as saying "of what is, that it is, or of what is not, that it is not."
<br>Justification involves careful observation and investigation of scientific matters.


<br>
The Doctrine of the Four Causes:  Aristotle's explanation of why something is the way it is.

<br>Material Cause:  The stuff something is made of (e.g., rubber for a tire).
<br>Formal Cause:  The shape, pattern, or structure (e.g., the circular shape of a tire).
<br>Efficient Cause:  The agent or process that brings something into being (e.g., the manufacturing process of a tire).
<br>Final Cause:  The purpose or goal (e.g., providing a safe interface between car and road).


<br>
Metaphysics: Substance, Potentiality, and Actuality:

<br>Substance:  For Aristotle, substance is not a separate Form but the combination of form and matter in individual things.
<br>Potentiality and Actuality:  Matter is potentiality (the capacity to become something), and form is actualized matter (the realization of that potential).  Change is the process of moving from potentiality to actuality.
<br>Entelechy:  The inherent purpose or end towards which something strives.


<br>
The Unmoved Mover:  Aristotle's concept of a first cause, not as a creator in a theological sense, but as the principle of motion.  It is pure actuality, eternally attracting all things towards their natural ends.  It is the reason for motion.

<br>
Critical Observations:

<br>
Rationalism may not infallibly establish causes of events in the world

<br>
Classificatory schemes are not necessarily essential knowledge

<br>VII. Summary: The Enduring Questions<br>
<br>The Pre-Socratics began to think about knowledge and reality as problems to be investigated.
<br>Plato believed that true knowledge is of the unchanging realm of the Forms and that the philosopher-king is best equipped to grasp this essential knowledge.
<br>Aristotle saw knowledge as something more generally accessible. It involves the interplay of sense perception, reason, and intuition.
<br>These notes provide a framework for understanding the key concepts and arguments presented in the text.

 <br><br><br>
<br>Philosophy has evolved from a narrow, detached discipline to a more integrated approach, incorporating perception, feeling, and thought (neologism: "perfink").
<br>Philosophers are influenced by their historical and cultural contexts, shaping their worldviews and ideas.
<br>Understanding the history of philosophy is crucial for grasping modern philosophical thought, as contemporary ideas often reflect on and respond to earlier works.
<br><br>
<br>Philosophy involves the rational justification of intuitive perceptions about existence, focusing on the "what," "how," and "why" of life.
<br>It is a dynamic process of debate and self-criticism, where definitions and theories are continually refined.
<br>Philosophy arises from everyday experiences and seeks to provide rational justification for these experiences.
<br><br>
<br>Greek philosophy emerged in the 6th century BCE with the Milesian School, which sought to explain the natural world without relying on mythology.
<br>The Milesians focused on identifying the Arche (the first cause or governing principle of the world).
<br><br>
<br>Thales: Proposed water as the fundamental element, observing its transformative properties (e.g., evaporation, condensation).
<br>Anaximander: Criticized Thales, suggesting the Apeiron (the unlimited or boundless) as the source of all things.
<br>Anaximenes: Introduced the mechanism of condensation and rarefaction, identifying air as the primary substance.
<br><br>
<br>Heraclitus: Emphasized constant change, stating, "One cannot step into the same river twice." He viewed fire as the symbol of eternal flux.
<br>Parmenides: Argued that change is an illusion, positing that being is eternal, indivisible, and unchanging.
<br><br>
<br>Professional educators who prioritized persuasion over truth.
<br>Believed in subjective truth, rejecting the idea of objective knowledge.
<br>Their relativistic views influenced postmodern philosophical thought.
<br><br>
<br>Known through Plato's dialogues, Socrates employed the Socratic Method, a systematic questioning to define essential concepts like justice or courage.
<br>Believed that knowledge is virtue, emphasizing self-awareness and ethical living.
<br><br>
<br>Theory of Forms: Argued that true knowledge exists in the unchanging world of Forms, separate from the physical world of sensory perception.
<br>Epistemology: Knowledge is certain and eternal, accessed through reason and recollection, not sensory experience.
<br>Anamnesis: Knowledge is recollected from the soul's pre-existence in the world of Forms.
<br><br>
<br>Developed the concepts of substance and cause, categorizing knowledge into substance (essence) and accidents (non-essential properties).
<br>Emphasized the four causes: material, formal, efficient, and final, to explain the nature of objects and processes.
<br><br>
<br>Epistemology: Study of knowledge, truth, belief, and justification.
<br>Metaphysics: Study of the fundamental nature of reality, focusing on substance and causality.
<br>Forms: Plato's theory that universal concepts (e.g., beauty, justice) exist independently of physical objects.
<br><br>
<br>How did the dialogue between Pre-Socratic thinkers advance philosophical inquiry?
<br>Does Plato's allegory of the cave effectively explain the acquisition of knowledge?
<br>How do Socrates' and the Sophists' views on knowledge differ?
<br><br>
<br>The Pre-Socratics, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle laid the foundation for Western philosophy, addressing fundamental questions about knowledge, reality, and ethics.
<br>Their ideas remain relevant, influencing contemporary philosophical thought and providing a framework for ongoing debate and inquiry.
<br><br><br>
<br>Definition of Knowledge:

<br>Knowledge must be true; if something is not true, it cannot be known.
<br>Knowledge involves perceiving the conformity of a thing to its archetype in the realm of Forms.


<br>Mental States in Knowing:

<br>Knowledge is contrasted with belief; knowledge implies acceptance or assertion of a fact.
<br>For Plato, knowledge is an intellectual state of recognizing truth, independent of the material world, which offers only deceptive appearances.


<br>Criticism of Plato‚Äôs Theory:

<br>Forms and Particulars:

<br>Difficulty in explaining how Forms relate to one another and to the particulars they exemplify.
<br>The "Third Man Argument" by Aristotle: If the Form of Man is what all men resemble, is it not just another man?


<br>Relational Terms:

<br>Terms like ‚Äútall‚Äù or ‚Äúshort‚Äù are relative and lack absolute meaning, challenging the existence of universal Forms.


<br>Universals vs. Particulars:

<br>Realist approaches like Plato's face difficulties in explaining how universals and particulars can both be legitimate objects of knowledge.




<br><br>
<br>Perception and Reason:

<br>Knowledge begins with sensory perception but requires reason to discern unchanging essential qualities.
<br>Knowledge is categorized as:

<br>Contingent: Undifferentiated and changing (e.g., plants).
<br>Universal/Genus: Shared qualities (e.g., trees).
<br>Essential/Species: Unique qualities (e.g., oak trees).




<br>Essential Properties and Four Causes:

<br>Essential properties are discovered through:

<br>Material Cause: The substance something is made of.
<br>Formal Cause: Its structure or pattern.
<br>Efficient Cause: The agent or process that brings it into being.
<br>Final Cause: Its purpose or goal.




<br>Knowledge of Forms:

<br>Forms are interdependent with particulars; neither can exist without the other.
<br>Knowledge is gained through observation and reasoning about particulars, not innate recollection as Plato suggested.


<br>Induction and Deduction:

<br>Induction: Generalizing from observations of particulars.
<br>Deduction: Logically deriving properties from essential attributes.


<br>Nous (Intuition):

<br>Reveals causes and reasoned facts.
<br>Superior to scientific knowledge as truth is known directly.


<br>Criticism of Aristotle‚Äôs Approach:

<br>Assumes reason is an infallible guide to causation.
<br>Fails to consider that different types of knowledge may require different justifications.


<br><br>
<br>Nature of Reality:

<br>Plato: Ultimate reality lies in the Forms, which are eternal and unchanging.
<br>Aristotle: Ultimate reality lies in physical objects, with Forms interdependent with particulars.


<br>Source of Knowledge:

<br>Plato: Knowledge is recollected from a pre-bodily existence.
<br>Aristotle: Knowledge is derived from sensory perception and reasoning.


<br>Justification of Knowledge:

<br>Both agree knowledge must be true, believed, and justified.
<br>Aristotle emphasizes extensive observation and the dynamic nature of truth.


<br><br>
<br>Material Cause: The substance (e.g., rubber for a tire).
<br>Formal Cause: The structure or pattern (e.g., circular shape of a tire).
<br>Efficient Cause: The agent or process (e.g., molding rubber for a tire).
<br>Final Cause: The purpose or goal (e.g., safe driving for a tire).
<br><br>
<br>Change and Potentiality:

<br>Matter is potentiality; form is actualized matter.
<br>Change involves transitioning from potentiality to actuality.


<br>Unmoved Mover:

<br>The eternal principle of motion, acting as a final cause by inspiring striving towards ends.


<br><br>
<br>Reason and Causation:

<br>Assumption that reason can infallibly identify causes is challenged by modern science.


<br>Classification Systems:

<br>Grouping entities based on common properties may not reveal necessary associations.


<br><br>
<br>Can relational terms like ‚Äútall‚Äù or ‚Äúshort‚Äù be universal Forms?
<br>Do you agree with Plato that universals must be known before particulars?
<br>How do we determine true definitions and causes?
<br>Which view is more compelling: Plato‚Äôs Forms or Aristotle‚Äôs physical objects as ultimate reality?
<br><br>
<br>Philosophy is an ongoing discussion about knowledge (epistemology) and reality (metaphysics).
<br>Plato and Aristotle both view knowledge as a necessary relation between events but differ in their methods and understanding of reality.
<br>Aristotle‚Äôs approach is grounded in observation and reasoning about the physical world, while Plato emphasizes the transcendent realm of Forms.
<br><br><br>
<br>Philosophy is the rational justification of intuitive perceptions about existence, encompassing what, how, and why things exist.
<br>The study of philosophy involves a continual debate and self-criticism to refine concepts and theories.
<br>The history of philosophy provides essential context for understanding contemporary philosophical thought.
<br><br>
<br>Milesian School: Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes sought the "Arche" (first principle) to explain the universe's origin and transformations.

<br>Thales: Proposed water as the fundamental element.
<br>Anaximander: Introduced the concept of the "apeiron" (the boundless) as the source of all things.
<br>Anaximenes: Suggested air as the primary substance, undergoing condensation and rarefaction to create all matter.


<br>Heraclitus: Emphasized constant change, symbolized by fire, and introduced the concept of the "logos" as the universal principle of transformation.
<br>Parmenides: Argued that change is an illusion, positing that reality is unchanging, indivisible, and eternal.
<br><br>
<br>Professional educators who emphasized persuasion over truth.
<br>Believed in subjective truth and rejected the possibility of objective knowledge.
<br><br>
<br>Known through Plato's dialogues, Socrates employed the Socratic method of questioning to seek essential definitions.
<br>Emphasized the importance of self-knowledge and intellectual inquiry.
<br><br>
<br>Theory of Forms: Reality exists in a realm of unchanging, perfect forms, separate from the physical world.
<br>Knowledge is innate, recollected through reason, and distinct from opinion.
<br>The physical world is a mere shadow of the world of forms.
<br>Advocated for the pursuit of wisdom as the highest virtue.
<br><br>
<br>Epistemology: Knowledge is derived from sensory experience and refined through reason.
<br>Four Causes:

<br>Material Cause: The substance of an object.
<br>Formal Cause: The structure or form of an object.
<br>Efficient Cause: The agent or process that brings an object into being.
<br>Final Cause: The purpose or goal of an object.


<br>Metaphysics: Reality consists of individual substances, each a combination of form and matter.
<br>The Unmoved Mover: The ultimate cause of motion, existing as pure actuality and the source of all change.
<br><br>
<br>Epistemology: The study of knowledge, truth, belief, and justification.
<br>Metaphysics: The study of the nature of reality, substance, and causation.
<br>The Doctrine of the Mean: Aristotle's ethical principle of balance and moderation.
<br><br>
<br>Plato's theory of forms faces challenges, such as the "third man" argument and the difficulty of explaining participation between forms and particulars.
<br>Aristotle's reliance on reason and causation has been critiqued for its limitations in explaining chance and contingency.
<br><br>
<br>Philosophy is a dynamic and evolving discipline, rooted in the historical and intellectual contexts of its thinkers.
<br>The theories of knowledge and reality proposed by Plato and Aristotle remain foundational in philosophical inquiry.

There is an awful caricature that, for good reason still exists in many people's minds. It is the picture of a philosopher who was a balding, middle aged, acerbic eccentric white male (usually a professor) who peruses a narrow band of knowledge found within ancient musty books and obscure academic journals. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=23&amp;annotation=3681R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=23&amp;annotation=3681R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=23&amp;annotation=3681R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.23</a>

Sir Ken Robinson recently observed that possibly a university professor's body was only a biological machine to transport his mind to meetings. Today that has all changed. Maybe the idea of thinking as a detached mental process is outmoded, we should possibly use the neologism ‚Äúperfink'' (i.e. we perceive, feel and think simultaneously (Bruner 1986:118). <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=23&amp;annotation=3687R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=23&amp;annotation=3687R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=23&amp;annotation=3687R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.23</a>

It would, in our estimation, be really tragic if the only philosophy you read this year was the study guide <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=24&amp;selection=7,0,13,49&amp;color=red" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&amp;selection=7,0,13,49&amp;color=red" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&amp;selection=7,0,13,49&amp;color=red" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.24</a>

This means that despite often being revolutionary thinkers, a philosopher is trapped within her particular historical period's world view. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=24&amp;selection=37,0,41,76&amp;color=yellow" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&amp;selection=37,0,41,76&amp;color=yellow" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&amp;selection=37,0,41,76&amp;color=yellow" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.24</a>

When you begin to understand the world views that many philosophers lived inside of, fascinating philosophical questions appear about the nature of human consciousness <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=24&amp;annotation=3690R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&amp;annotation=3690R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&amp;annotation=3690R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.24</a>

<br>Have you ever wondered how in ancient history some people claimed to literally ‚Äúhear the voice of God?''

Their ideas differed from their predecessors in that their philosophy did not include myth. In various ways, the philosopher- scientists' elucidation of their ideas marks the origin of Western philosophy. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=24&amp;selection=103,30,151,0&amp;color=yellow" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&amp;selection=103,30,151,0&amp;color=yellow" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&amp;selection=103,30,151,0&amp;color=yellow" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.24</a>

We shall briefly look at the opposing approaches of Parmenides and Heraclitus, whose significance as philosophers lies in the way in which Socrates and Plato both attempted to overcome the impasse created by their opposing views. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=24&amp;annotation=3696R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&amp;annotation=3696R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&amp;annotation=3696R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.24</a>

The only way to discover what philosophy is, is to do it and to construct a definition as we proceed. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=26&amp;annotation=3711R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3711R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3711R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.26</a>
<br>
Let us begin with a very simplistic and provisional definition and then qualify and modify our definition as we become better acquainted with the discipline of philosophy. This is the traditional method of philosophizing, by the way: a continual debate, or running self-criticism, in which insights are acquired and developed by a continual discussion <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=26&amp;annotation=3714R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3714R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3714R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.26</a>

Philosophy is the rational justification of our intuitive perceptions about the what, the how and the why of existence <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=26&amp;annotation=3717R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3717R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3717R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.26</a>

Put in slightly more abstract terms A piece of [philosophical] knowledge is never false or true - but only more or less biologically and evolutionary useful. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=26&amp;annotation=3720R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3720R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3720R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.26</a>
<br>
All knowledge advances by discussion, including in the sciences. What is agreed and accepted is no longer of vital interest. The growing point of every branch of knowledge is the region of perpetual debate. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=26&amp;annotation=3723R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3723R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3723R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.26</a>
<br>
Philosophising is a method which tries to define some concept provisionally, as that concept appears to common sense (eg the common sense concept of justice). The philosophical method will then examine the definition, develop its implications to discover whether these implications are self- consistent, and correct this definition wherever it is found wanting. In doing this, philosophising will lead to a different definition and a new theory of the defined concept. Philosophy will then proceed with a critique of this new definition and theory and, in the process; this will lead to more disagreement and more advancement. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=26&amp;annotation=3726R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3726R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3726R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.26</a>
<br>
The history of philosophy also becomes a dialogue and a discussion one which is never stale or dead because the issues are still current and are always, in some way, directly or indirectly, the concern of every thinking person. (See Stumpf &amp; Abel 2002:6;19; 551;566.) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=26&amp;annotation=3729R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3729R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3729R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.26</a>
<br><br>
We cannot fully understand contemporary philosophy or what modern philosophers are doing apart from their historical background, because the work of modern philosophers is, to a very large extent, a reflection upon the work of their predecessors <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=26&amp;annotation=3732R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3732R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&amp;annotation=3732R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.26</a>

Philosophy arises out of our ordinary everyday ideas and experiences <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=27&amp;annotation=3735R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&amp;annotation=3735R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&amp;annotation=3735R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.27</a>
<br>
We take it for granted today that no theory about what happens in the world around us is of much value unless it is based upon, and can be tested by, observation and experiment. But before the 17th century this approach would not have occurred even to highly educated and intelligent people; until the 17th century, everyone would have almost certainly rejected personal observations in preference to statements backed by high authority. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=27&amp;annotation=3738R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&amp;annotation=3738R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&amp;annotation=3738R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.27</a>
<br>
to properly understand these ideas, as philosophers we must know how and when they originated. And, to understand their history, we must not only study past theories, but must rethink them, redevelop them in our own thought, and thus enable ourselves to formulate new ideas that go beyond those of our predecessors <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=27&amp;annotation=3741R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&amp;annotation=3741R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&amp;annotation=3741R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.27</a>

‚ÄúPhilosophy'' is derived from the Greek philein, literally meaning ‚Äúto love'' and sophia meaning ‚Äúwisdom'', so philosophy literally means the ‚Äúlove of wisdom'' <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=27&amp;annotation=3744R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&amp;annotation=3744R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&amp;annotation=3744R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.27</a>

Plato's philosophy is the product of reflection upon the thought of the two preceding centuries, one of the most intellectually productive periods of human history. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=27&amp;annotation=3747R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&amp;annotation=3747R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&amp;annotation=3747R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.27</a>
<br>
In line with the method of contextualization of ancient Greek thought, we need to begin by briefly examining the principal features of Greek mythological thought <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=27&amp;annotation=3750R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&amp;annotation=3750R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&amp;annotation=3750R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.27</a>
<br>
In mythological thought, the mind is held in thrall by sense impressions. Exposure to the world of natural phenomena led the people of ancient Greece to form anthropomorphic plastic images of these phenomena. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=27&amp;annotation=3753R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&amp;annotation=3753R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&amp;annotation=3753R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.27</a>
<br>
The popularisation of these myths led to Homeric mythology becoming the object of public worship in Greek city-states such as Athens and Miletus. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=28&amp;annotation=3756R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&amp;annotation=3756R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&amp;annotation=3756R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.28</a>
<br>
In mythological thought, there is an attempt at discerning and establishing order<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=28&amp;annotation=3759R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&amp;annotation=3759R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&amp;annotation=3759R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.28</a>
<br>
The essential difference between scientific/philosophical thought and mythological thought is that, in mythological thought, the mind is wrapped up in cosmic events to such an extent that the testimony of the senses is accepted and received in a na√Øve, and totally uncritical, manner. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=28&amp;annotation=3762R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&amp;annotation=3762R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&amp;annotation=3762R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.28</a>
<br>
The evolution of philosophical thought from mythology may be seen as the outcome of humankind's changing experience of reality and the specific needs arising from this changing reality. This is why the concept of knowledge changes and why the first philosophers came into conflict with the advocates of the traditional values of the city-state, values that were based on the mythology of Homer <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=28&amp;annotation=3765R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&amp;annotation=3765R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&amp;annotation=3765R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.28</a>

Greek philosophy is usually taken to begin in the 6th century BCE, with the Ionian School or the Milesians, named after the city of Miletus, on the Ionian coast. The three best-known of the Milesian philosophers were: Thales (¬±625-545 BC), Anaximander (¬± 611-545 BC), and Anaximenes (¬±585-525 BC) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=28&amp;annotation=3768R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&amp;annotation=3768R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&amp;annotation=3768R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.28</a>

Greek philosophy is mainly the offspring, as it were, of material and economic needs and interests. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=28&amp;annotation=3771R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&amp;annotation=3771R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&amp;annotation=3771R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.28</a>
<br><br>
The Milesians were all preoccupied by a single problem, namely: What is the first governing principle of the world by which chaos (unformed or amorphous matter) is turned into cosmos (formed or intelligible matter)? <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=29&amp;annotation=3774R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3774R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3774R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.29</a>
<br>
The prevailing wisdom of the time, which was part of Greek mythology, was that there are four basic elements, namely Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=29&amp;annotation=3777R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3777R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3777R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.29</a>
<br>
The Milesians disagreed with this view, and claimed that a single element was somehow more basic than the others.

Thales suggested that the underlying first principle was Water. He may have thought that, if the initial state of things was a mass of water, and the earth arose out of water, what is underneath the earth, supporting it, but the water out of which it arose? If there was, in the beginning, nothing else to support water why should water need support now? <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=29&amp;annotation=3783R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3783R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3783R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.29</a>

Thales's view was criticized by fellow Milesian, Anaximander <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=29&amp;annotation=3795R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3795R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3795R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.29</a>
<br>
Anaximander's purpose was to describe the inhabited earth geological, biological, and cultural. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=29&amp;annotation=3798R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3798R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3798R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.29</a>
<br>
One of his most striking hypotheses is that the cosmos of earth, sun, moon, and stars is not unique. Anaximander claimed that there is, at any moment, an unlimited number of such worlds, all of which arise from ‚Äúthe unlimited'' (apeiron). <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=29&amp;annotation=3801R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3801R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3801R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.29</a>
<br>
This apeiron is that from which all the worlds and all that is in them are separated out and into which they are again absorbed <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=29&amp;annotation=3804R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3804R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3804R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.29</a>

Anaximander's objection to Thales is that, since water is quantitatively exhaustible, it could not be the arche. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=29&amp;annotation=3807R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3807R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&amp;annotation=3807R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.29</a>

The arche, therefore had to be something in which the elements rested in a perfectly unmixed state, hence his conception of the apeiron <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=30&amp;annotation=3810R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&amp;annotation=3810R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&amp;annotation=3810R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.30</a>

Anaximenes suggested a single natural operating mechanism, for which he found evidence in the physical world. This was the mechanism of condensation-rarefaction. All change of every kind he regarded as the result of this one mechanism. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=30&amp;annotation=3816R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&amp;annotation=3816R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&amp;annotation=3816R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.30</a>

If we compress the air we exhale with our lips it appears cold; if we relax our lips in exhalation, it is rarefied and becomes hot. If then it is compressed further, it becomes water and finally earth and stones; but if further rarefied, it becomes fire. These changes of one thing into another are really an indication of a change in the density of the underlying element which Anaximenes called air. Anaximenes's analysis of all objects and events in the physical world as aspects and functions of a single quantitative process is the ultimate achievement of Milesian philosophy. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=30&amp;annotation=3819R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&amp;annotation=3819R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&amp;annotation=3819R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.30</a>

The lifestyle of the inhabitants of Miletus gradually changed from being an agricultural one to a maritime one. Their increasing reliance upon regularity in natural occurrences (tides, winds, etc.) encouraged them to find out as much as they could about the patterns in nature. However, just why they thought a single cause was better than a variety of causes is unclear, even today <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=30&amp;annotation=3825R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&amp;annotation=3825R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&amp;annotation=3825R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.30</a>

Anaximenes claimed that water is air that has been re-arranged by compression, and that air is water that has been re-arranged by rarefaction. Does it therefore follow that nothing is anything but a different degree of anything else, and that only the process itself remains fixed? If all is one and unchanging, how can it appear to be many and variable? <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=30&amp;annotation=3828R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&amp;annotation=3828R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&amp;annotation=3828R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.30</a>

The Milesians' crude materialistic approach to the problem of the Arche‚Äô was opposed by both Heraclitus (¬± 540-470 BCE) and Parmenides (¬±540-480 BCE). Both thinkers thought that the arche was not accessible to sense perception, but could only be grasped by rational insight and intuition. Nor could the arche, like Anaximander's apeiron, merely be said to contain all the elements in an unmixed state. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=30&amp;annotation=3831R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&amp;annotation=3831R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&amp;annotation=3831R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.30</a>
<br><br>
Rather than search for an underlying unity, Heraclitus got rid of the difficulty of reconciling permanence and change by claiming that nothing in the universe is permanent. Everything, he claimed, is continually changing. All things are in a constant state of flux. ‚ÄúOne cannot step into the same river twice.'' Heraclitus regarded Fire as the ultimate reality because, like nature itself, Fire is forever passing away and renewing itself. The universe, he believed, was a perpetual conflagration in which solid earth melted to water and evaporated to air which was then transmuted into fire. Smoke and ash from fire descended upon earth and were rekindled into fire, thus beginning the cycle again. ‚ÄúThe world is an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling and measures going out.' <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=31&amp;annotation=3834R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=31&amp;annotation=3834R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=31&amp;annotation=3834R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.31</a>
<br>
In addition to the doctrine of change, Heraclitus recognized a principle of nature which he called the logos. The logos is the principle that everything changes. It is a universal principle and remains unchanged. The logos states that all things pass into their opposites, or are constituted by the union of their opposites. The union is not permanent, but a tension between forces driving them either on the path to Fire which is, at the same time, the starting point of the endless repetition of the cycle of transformation. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=31&amp;annotation=3837R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=31&amp;annotation=3837R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=31&amp;annotation=3837R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.31</a>
<br>
Heraclitus's disciple, Cratylus, saw that if one took this theory seriously, no permanence would be left, not even the permanence of the law of change. If everything changes, even the words we use, the meanings they have will constantly change. In other words, we could not have a constant language to describe the world we live in. So Cratylus concluded that one cannot step into the same river even ONCE, because, by the time one stepped into it, the river had changed. Because he thought that word-meanings were constantly changing (indeed, the speaker, the words, their meanings, and the listener, all change), it is said that Cratylus therefore refused to make statements. Instead, he would just wiggle his little finger when spoken to, to indicate that he had heard. It would have been futile for Cratylus to make any response, for the universe would not stand still long enough for him to make his response <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=31&amp;annotation=3845R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=31&amp;annotation=3845R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=31&amp;annotation=3845R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.31</a>
<br><br>
In Cratylus's thought, it is clear that certain presuppositions (which we commonly make) about knowledge are in operation. To begin with, it is assumed that only what is true can rank as knowledge and that truth is absolute - either all or nothing. In other words, what is not quite true is not true at all and so is not knowledge. It is also assumed that what is true is always true, which means that the object of knowledge must be true and unchanging. What constantly changes cannot be an object of knowledge. What changes never remains (and so never properly is) what at any moment it is said to be. Instead, it is constantly becoming something else what it is not. It neither is nor is not precisely anything and yet it is both something and something else a very confusing state of affairs indeed! <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=31&amp;annotation=3848R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=31&amp;annotation=3848R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=31&amp;annotation=3848R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.31</a>

Parmenides took the view that what we call change is an illusion. One may briefly summarize his argument as follows: true change must mean that something that was not at one time, later comes into being. But how can something come into being? Only in one of two ways: either from something else or out of nothing. If it comes out of something else, it already existed; if it came out of nothing, then ‚Äúnothing'' must be treated as though it had some being; otherwise it would be absurd to think that something could come out of nothing, or out of nonbeing. Either way, then, the phrase ‚Äúcomes into being'' must mean that what we call change refers to what already exists, in which case there is no real change <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=32&amp;annotation=3851R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=32&amp;annotation=3851R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=32&amp;annotation=3851R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.32</a>
<br>
What is could never have come into being, because that would imply a time when it was not when nothing was which is impossible. It could not come into being from what is other than being, because there is nothing other than being. For the same reason, ‚Äúwhat is'' cannot cease to be for then it would pass into what is not being and that, too, is impossible. Likewise, if being is identical with itself, it must be indivisible because if ‚Äúwhat is not, is not'' and ‚Äúbeing is'', it follows that what could divide any one portion of it from any other could only be ‚Äúwhat is not''. If it were anything else, it would be identical with being and there would be no division. It follows, further, that no part of being can be other than or different from any other part of being, because what is other would be other than being not being and there is no not being, and so no other. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=32&amp;annotation=3859R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=32&amp;annotation=3859R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=32&amp;annotation=3859R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.32</a>
<br>
Parmenides concluded thus that being is one, uncreated and indestructible. There is no ‚Äúother'' and so there cannot be a ‚Äúmany'' or more than one. Because there cannot be a change within the one, there can be no movement, for movement is a form of change. There is no place where ‚Äúwhat is'' is not, so ‚Äúwhat is'' cannot move. Consequently all variety, movement, multiplicity, difference, and so on, is illusory and mere appearance. The theories describing the world in these terms are what Parmenides called ‚ÄúThe Way of Belief '' as opposed to his way, which was ‚ÄúThe Way of Truth'' <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=32&amp;annotation=3862R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=32&amp;annotation=3862R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=32&amp;annotation=3862R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.32</a>
<br>
The significance of this logical, but peculiar, argument is seen when we contrast it with the views of Heraclitus. Whereas Heraclitus recommends disregarding sensation and paying attention to a logos which we may discover through introspection, Parmenides denies that introspection is any more reliable than sensation. The logos which Parmenides recommends us to follow is pure reason, which is the source of Being itself: the structure of rational thought reflects the nature of Being itself. Parmenides's argument sets out to prove that the identity of what is precludes the possibility of any characteristic except just being. The essential nature of Being, the inner necessity that a thing is identical with itself, does not permit it to come to be nor to pass away. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=32&amp;annotation=3865R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=32&amp;annotation=3865R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=32&amp;annotation=3865R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.32</a>

<br><br>
The groundwork for the thought of the ancient Milesian cosmologists was the then current theory that the world consists of four basic elements (air, earth, fire, and water). All preSocratic philosophers, however, considered that ONE element was more basic than any other (they were monists). Thales decided that water is somehow the most basic element. Anaximander disagreed and settled upon an unspecified element that he saw as undergoing transformation. Anaximenes was unhappy with the vague account of transformation suggested by Anaximander and suggested another element and, more importantly, a detailed account of the process. Heraclitus took a broader view of the process of transformation and identified fire as the symbol of eternal change. Parmenides totally disagreed with him and, indeed, with all his predecessors. Parmenides tried to show the contradiction involved in speaking about change when the language of change is subjected to strict logical analysis. His peculiar conceptual logic serves to elucidate some of the implications of such strict logical thought. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=33&amp;annotation=3871R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&amp;annotation=3871R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&amp;annotation=3871R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.33</a>

The Sophists were a group of 5th century (BCE) professional educators.

<br>Philosophy has proved that no two philosophers think alike. If there is no change, there can be no knowledge because, in that case, we cannot describe anything. (Because description implies that a thing which is identical with itself is also something else.) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=33&amp;annotation=3880R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&amp;annotation=3880R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&amp;annotation=3880R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.33</a>
<br>If things change, the same is true because, where nothing persists, we cannot attribute anything to anything <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=33&amp;annotation=3883R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&amp;annotation=3883R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&amp;annotation=3883R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.33</a>
<br>If we can know things only in so far as they influence our senses, we also cannot know, because then the nature of things eludes our grasp. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=33&amp;annotation=3886R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&amp;annotation=3886R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&amp;annotation=3886R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.33</a>

The Sophistic position on knowledge is that there is no objective truth - only subjective opinion. The individual is a law unto himself in the matter of knowledge <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=33&amp;annotation=3892R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&amp;annotation=3892R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&amp;annotation=3892R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.33</a>
<br><br>There seem to be two sets of laws that operate in the world:<br>
<br>The laws of nature, gravity being the obvious one. If I decide to jump out of a 5 story building I will hit the ground and the impact will kill me. Everybody else who similarly attempts this feat without a safety net will in all probability also die. The laws of nature thus appear to be universal <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=34&amp;annotation=3895R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&amp;annotation=3895R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&amp;annotation=3895R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.34</a>
<br>Then there are laws that appear to belong to particular societies. For example different religious groups stop work and celebrate different days of the year they deem sacred. These laws for these observances only apply to followers of these societies. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=34&amp;annotation=3898R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&amp;annotation=3898R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&amp;annotation=3898R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.34</a>

In our day many postmodern philosophers adopt the Sophist stand point. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=34&amp;annotation=3901R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&amp;annotation=3901R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&amp;annotation=3901R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.34</a>


<br>
It does not take much for the tenuous gossamer web of life to come apart. A stray bullet, a stray chromosome, a stray virus and wanton cellular division - and the flesh is hopelessly ruined. Events strike a very delicate balance; they form frail, fragile, vulnerable configurations and micro connections. They are easy prey to chance and misfortune and mishap. Joy is sustained on a tissue-thin surface, a tissue of flesh. [...] To speak of what happens is to give up looking for the meaning of events, because while events give joy or sorrow, they do not, as a whole have Meaning. While there are numerous meanings in events, there is no meaning to events overall, no overarching meaning which is their point, their logos or telos, their sum and their substance. The sum and substance of events are nothing other than the events themselves. There is no deep structure that sustains what we believe or cherish, what we savor in life, none at least that we know of.'' (Caputo 1993:234-235) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=34&amp;annotation=3904R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&amp;annotation=3904R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&amp;annotation=3904R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.34</a>

We have no written records of the ideas of the historical Socrates, any more than we have of Thales. What we do have are the writings of his famous pupil, Plato. Because the dialogues of Plato are the only worthwhile source for the philosophy of Socrates, it is usual to attribute the following ideas to Plato (who used the name ‚ÄúSocrates‚Äù as a character in his philosophical dialogues) rather than to Socrates. One of the most striking characteristics one encounters in reading Plato's dialogues is the practice of the Socratic method. In Plato's dialogues, the Socratic method takes the form of a systematic questioning, a search for a defensible (acceptable) definition of a word. Such a definition would give an exact account of the essential nature of the object to which it referred. By ‚Äúessential‚Äù is meant something which is peculiarly central to the object. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=34&amp;annotation=3907R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&amp;annotation=3907R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&amp;annotation=3907R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.34</a>
<br>
This essential then needs to be stated in a way that gives us, in a nutshell, enough information to tell us what that object really is. Socrates suggested no formal rules for arriving at satisfactory definitions. Instead, his approach was the argument of negativity. In other words, he would argue that, merely enumerating instances of, say, ‚Äútrue'' statements could not serve as a definition of justice. Instead, he supposed that, because all true statements were called ‚Äútrue'', there was something they had in common apart from the use of the term ‚Äútrue'' and it was this ‚Äúsomething'' that was to be defined or accounted for. Also, Socrates would not accept as a definition a word or phrase that contained, either explicitly or tacitly, the word to be defined because, he claimed, this was circular reasoning. If a suggestion passed these grounds, it was then tested by reasoning. Socrates took the definition as one of the premises (initial assumptions) of the argument, the others being agreed upon, sometimes after yet further consideration. Deductions were then made from this set of premises, and the result might be unsatisfactory either because a contradiction was reached or because a conclusion was drawn which was in conflict with the obvious facts. In either case, it followed that there was something wrong with the premises. Since all of these except the suggested definition had been agreed upon, it had to be the definition itself which was faulty, and which therefore had to be rejected. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=35&amp;annotation=3910R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=35&amp;annotation=3910R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=35&amp;annotation=3910R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.35</a>
<br>Below is an example of the famous Socratic Method:<br>

<br>Why does Socrates ask such a simple question? 
<br>What is the purpose of the ambiguity that Socrates creates? 
<br>At this stage of the argument Laches' definition of courage has changed quite considerably. Do you think it is a better definition? Why? 4. At this point in the argument how would you describe Laches' feelings? If you think he is becoming frustrated, you would be correct. Why would a great teacher like Socrates want to provoke his pupil like this? If you study philosophy, are you comfortable being provoked, or as we might say in a more contemporary image, ‚Äúpushed out of your comfort zone‚Äù? <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=35&amp;annotation=3913R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=35&amp;annotation=3913R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=35&amp;annotation=3913R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.35</a>

Epistemology is the theory or science of the methods or grounds of knowledge. Basically, epistemology wrestles with the question What can I know? Our historical account so far has been an exercise in the practice of the epistemology and metaphysics (What is the fundamental nature of reality?) of the pre-Socratic thinkers. When we turn to Socrates, though, we are introduced to the entire range of philosophical problems from problems concerned with knowledge (epistemology); with underlying reality (metaphysics); with grounds for distinguishing good from evil (ethics); and with grounds and principles upon which laws and states are constituted (political philosophy) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=38&amp;annotation=3928R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=38&amp;annotation=3928R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=38&amp;annotation=3928R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.38</a>

<br>We are incarnated into the physical world of the senses and lose our memory of our prior existence in the world of the Forms. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=39&amp;annotation=3931R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&amp;annotation=3931R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&amp;annotation=3931R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.39</a>

<br>In order to have essential knowledge then we need access to knowledge that is unchanging and eternal which is located in the world of the Forms <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=39&amp;annotation=3937R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&amp;annotation=3937R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&amp;annotation=3937R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.39</a>

<br>

<br>For the above to happen we need to be able to remember the eternal truth and perfection that existed in the eternal world of the Forms.

At the heart of Plato's philosophy lies his belief that the ordinary world we know through our five senses cannot be fully real. Plato thought that this world is filled with change and decay (as Heraclitus and Parmenides had shown). But if we can ever be said to know something, that which we know must be true, and always remains true despite changing and deceptive appearances. So unless one adopts the methodic doubt of the Sophists that knowledge is unobtainable, there must be a world of stable and perfect objects behind the changing objects of sense perception. The ultimate task of the philosopher was to explore this world. This was Plato's way of resolving the dilemma faced by the successors of Heraclitus and Parmenides - it was his (and Socrates's) answer to the Sophists. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=39&amp;annotation=3943R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&amp;annotation=3943R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&amp;annotation=3943R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.39</a>
<br>
What are the characteristics of Plato's theory of knowledge? Well, basically, he argued that knowledge is inseparable from ethics - knowledge is virtue (ar√™te). ‚ÄúVirtue'' did not have the same meaning for Plato as it does for us. The western concept of virtue comes from the Christian heritage, whether or not we are Christian believers. For the Greeks, ar√™te could not stand on its own as ‚Äúvirtue'' can for us. For them, to be virtuous or to be good was to be virtuous in respect of something or to be good at something. So one would talk of a governing ar√™te (good at governing), or a military ar√™te (good at military affairs). Plato speaks of the ar√™te of dogs and horses, that is, their ability to perform their special function as dogs and horses. Plato reasoned that there must also be a human arete, shown by a person who was good at being a person, that is, at performing specifically human functions. The virtuous person was good at conducting his or her life as a human being. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=39&amp;annotation=3946R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&amp;annotation=3946R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&amp;annotation=3946R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.39</a>
<br>
Plato would only accept as knowledge what was completely beyond doubt and necessarily true. What was true but might have been otherwise, that is, what was a contingent, rather than a necessary truth, could only be an object of opinion. At best, this could be held as true belief, never as knowledge. For example, it is necessarily true that circles are round. However, it is only contingently true that balls are round. But one does not know that circles are round merely by looking at circles. The ideas of roundness being identical to circularity are arrived at by rational intuition (see below). One ‚Äúsees'' this in one's ‚Äúmind's eye'', as it were. This kind of ‚Äúseeing'' is very different from visual seeing, for instance. In fact, Plato believed that the bodily senses interfere with the pursuit of knowledge because they naturally lead to feelings and desires and these distort our powers of judgment and infect them with prejudice. Sense perception often misleads us and subjects us to illusion. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=39&amp;annotation=3949R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&amp;annotation=3949R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&amp;annotation=3949R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.39</a>
<br>
If we are to know to discover the truth about things we can only do so, said Plato, by gradually ceasing to rely upon the information of our senses and seeking, instead, that which is solely intelligible. A first approximation of examples of these readily available, intelligible items of knowledge are mathematical truths. The Platonic upliftment of thought even in fact becomes mystical. In its pursuit of knowledge, the soul (or mind) withdraws, as it were, from the body, suppresses the passions and desires to which the body gives rise, and confines itself to its special activity, namely, thinking. It is through pure thinking that one achieves wisdom. Wisdom is taken as the ultimate good because thinking and knowing are alleged to be the pure activity of the soul, doing what it can do best and what it can do better than any other agent. Since the philosopher pursues wisdom and truth, the philosopher must keep his soul pure of bodily contamination, from passion and desire and free himself from sensory illusion. The philosopher can never hope to do this completely until he dies, for death is the separation of soul from body. Consequently, said Plato, the philosopher will welcome, rather than fear, death (Stumpf &amp; Abel 2002:265-271). 
It was suggested above that one does not know that circles are round merely by looking. How do we determine what the real size and shape of bodies are? In the case of size, do we not rely upon measurement? But measurement requires the precise comparison of quantities, something which our senses cannot do. Furthermore, mere comparison is not enough we need to adopt precise units and count them. So we must use numbers. But these are not objects of sense perception. The notion of unity is purely ideal. We can, no doubt, apply it to whatever sensory object we please we may use any convenient quantity or thing as a unit (consider, for instance, the way we teach children arithmetic). But what a unit is, as such, we can never perceive directly. Unity is purely conceptual. 
Likewise, shape and the precise determination of shape, involve the use of geometrical concepts such as point, line and curve. Although these can be represented in sensory fashion, we never take the sensory diagram as more than an approximate illustration, nor is it ever completely accurate. Hence the ideas of line, circle, angle, etcetera are all ultimately abstract ideas, never strictly realisable in material media. So perhaps Plato has a point, after all <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=39&amp;annotation=3949R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&amp;annotation=3949R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&amp;annotation=3949R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.39</a>
<br><br>
In a well-known passage from his book Republic, Plato distinguishes between knowledge and opinion. He argues that knowledge is of the real, but that opinion is only of what seems to be the case but is in some way doubtful, confused or fluctuating, or all three together. Since, by definition, knowledge must imply truth, Plato thinks that the proper object of knowledge is actual reality (what the Greeks called Being). 
Plato then asks what would be the proper object of ignorance, and gives the obvious answer that it would be nothing (Nonbeing). He then makes the assertion that the object of opinion is a combination of being and nonbeing, which he calls Becoming.
For instance, we could say that a boy is a man, yet he is not a man but only a child. To give a precise account of anything that changes continuously we have to make seemingly contradictory statements about it. Or, take another example: no human being adequately represents or embodies what we mean by humanity, yet everyone does in some way represent and embody what we mean by the term. So, here again, we tend to say ‚Äúit is'' and ‚Äúit is not'' of the same object. In all such cases Plato thought the object of our awareness is imprecise, uncertain, and indeterminate. We can only have opinions about such matters, never knowledge. 
What is real must be unchanging, absolute, and universal. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=40&amp;annotation=3955R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=40&amp;annotation=3955R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=40&amp;annotation=3955R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.40</a>
<br>
These universals are usually translated by Plato's translators as Forms (Stumpf &amp; Abel 2002:38). The Forms are similar to mathematical entities in that they are not accessible to sense perception it is just as difficult to find a perfectly just act, good person or beautiful statue in the experienced world as it is to find a perfectly straight line or pair of parallel lines. In addition to beauty, justice, and goodness, Plato recognised Forms for the horse, the mountain, and so on. Generally speaking, there is a Form corresponding to every kind of thing there is. But the Forms, for Plato, are not merely concepts or ideas in our minds. They were supposed by him to exist quite independently of us and our thoughts. For Plato, they were the permanent objective reality to which, if we applied our mental powers, our concepts might correspond. Plato took a realist view of Forms (universals). This means that, whatever reality is ascribed to the objects which we are aware of through sense perception, is based on the fact that these objects of sense perception share, though to a limited and imperfect extent, in the nature of the Forms (universals). <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=41&amp;annotation=3958R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=41&amp;annotation=3958R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=41&amp;annotation=3958R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.41</a>

You may now appreciate the philosophical interest of the dialogue as to the essential nature of piety (holiness) which is your first textual reading (Stumpf &amp; Abel 2002:6-19). If we can find the essence of piety (not just an accidental property), we can apprehend the Form, and so acquire knowledge of piety. But the question which immediately arises is how can we know the nature of the Forms without being presented with these imperfect copies which will always tend to mislead us in our pursuit of the truth (the Forms)? Plato recognized that he could not demonstrate the existence of Forms by means of rational deductive argument. He also acknowledged that, in the end, his account had to be accepted on the basis of an intuitive belief that ultimate reality is immaterial and not accessible to sense perception. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=41&amp;annotation=3958R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=41&amp;annotation=3958R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=41&amp;annotation=3958R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.41</a>
<br>
But we should not on such grounds immediately dismiss the Platonic theory, for any theory that we give about the nature of the world must ultimately rest on intuitive beliefs which cannot be rationally justified <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=42&amp;annotation=3964R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=42&amp;annotation=3964R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=42&amp;annotation=3964R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.42</a>

At first we shall feel puzzled and afraid, but once we have become used to the light we shall appreciate that we have knowledge that was not available in the cave. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=42&amp;annotation=3964R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=42&amp;annotation=3964R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=42&amp;annotation=3964R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.42</a>

Plato's ‚ÄúTheory of Forms'' depends on acknowledging that the soul is immortal, or, at the very least, that it existed before it came to the material world <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=42&amp;annotation=3970R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=42&amp;annotation=3970R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=42&amp;annotation=3970R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.42</a>
<br><br>
Plato thought that the immaterial soul is independent of, and superior to, the material body. This view of the body and soul as two different substances is a form of dualism which is the dominant tradition in western metaphysics. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=42&amp;annotation=3970R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=42&amp;annotation=3970R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=42&amp;annotation=3970R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.42</a>
<br>
Plato thought that the soul belongs to the changeless world of Forms rather than to the changing world of sense perception. After death, the soul might go back to the world of Forms, although it might return once more to the material world at some later stage. But each time it returned within a body it was as though it had been once more imprisoned. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=42&amp;annotation=3976R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=42&amp;annotation=3976R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=42&amp;annotation=3976R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.42</a>
<br>
While in a material body the soul became polluted, and for this reason it would at least partially forget the world of Forms. Sense perception might serve to remind the soul of that world, but it could only begin to apprehend Forms because it had once known them fully. This explains the sense of familiarity with which people grasp a new point, the flash of recognition which accompanies new knowledge <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=42&amp;annotation=3979R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=42&amp;annotation=3979R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=42&amp;annotation=3979R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.42</a>
<br><br>It may be useful at this stage to provide a brief summary of the chief aspects of Plato's theory of knowledge:<br>

<br>Knowledge is permanent and certain, that is, it is not subject to correction <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=43&amp;annotation=3982R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=43&amp;annotation=3982R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=43&amp;annotation=3982R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.43</a>
<br>It is not possible to claim knowledge on the basis of sense perception and therefore it is not possible to claim knowledge of any object or event in the material world. The best we can aspire to is true belief <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=43&amp;annotation=3985R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=43&amp;annotation=3985R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=43&amp;annotation=3985R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.43</a>
<br>True belief can guide us and prompt the mind to remember the world of Forms. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=43&amp;annotation=3988R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=43&amp;annotation=3988R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=43&amp;annotation=3988R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.43</a>
<br>Forms are eternal and changeless and therefore they can be the objects of knowledge <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=43&amp;annotation=3991R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=43&amp;annotation=3991R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=43&amp;annotation=3991R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.43</a>
<br>Forms cannot be perceived by the senses; it is only the mind which makes us aware of them. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=43&amp;annotation=3994R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=43&amp;annotation=3994R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=43&amp;annotation=3994R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.43</a>

<br><br>
Mathematics is a form of knowledge that is independent of experience in a way that empirical sciences (e.g. chemistry) are not. But for that very reason we do not need to suppose pre-existent minds to explain how we may acquire it. All that is required is an understanding of the meanings of the terms used, such as straight line, triangle, or the words for numbers, together with certain assumptions about them which, in the case of Euclidean geometry, are derived from our experience of the world about us. They remain assumptions, however, and we argue only that if they are true, certain theorems resulting from them are also true. If a geometrical proof is set out formally, some of these assumptions will be treated as starting points (axioms), and the special terms used will be defined carefully. It then becomes clear that all we need for knowledge of geometry is the ability to understand these axioms and definitions plus the ability to draw deductive conclusions. This is the ability we use when we infer from the statement that Ben has a brother-in-law that Ben has a married sister. Plato's argument proves only that people naturally have this kind of reasoning ability and not that they existed before birth! <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=43&amp;annotation=4003R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=43&amp;annotation=4003R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=43&amp;annotation=4003R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.43</a>

How does Socrates's claim to preach a doctrine of ignorance differ from that of the skeptical Sophists? <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=44&amp;annotation=4006R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=44&amp;annotation=4006R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=44&amp;annotation=4006R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.44</a>
<br><br>
The Sophists adopted a Parmenidean skeptical approach to the problem of knowledge and defended any thesis as providing an opportunity to demonstrate their dialectical (argumentative) expertise. Socrates, however, sought intellectual (philosophical) clarity as an end in itself, even if that meant challenging common sense opinion. A belief which is difficult to grasp other-worldly truth underlies Socratic dialogue, whereas the sole aim of the reasoning of the Sophists was the transmission of technical expertise <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=44&amp;annotation=4009R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=44&amp;annotation=4009R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=44&amp;annotation=4009R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.44</a>

<br>
Why did Plato think that virtue depends on knowledge? 

<br>
Does Plato's allegory of the cave explain how we come to have knowledge of the Forms? <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=44&amp;annotation=4012R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=44&amp;annotation=4012R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=44&amp;annotation=4012R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.44</a>


<br><br><br>
The meaning of the word ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù is such that, if I claim to know something, that something must be logically true if I am making a serious claim to knowledge. In his writings Plato argues that knowledge must be true: if something is not true, he says, we cannot know it. According to Plato, it is only in so far as an individual mental state participates in the truth that we can call this mental state ‚Äúknowing‚Äù. And, as we have seen, truth, for Plato, consists essentially in the degree to which any particular thing conforms to the archetype of that thing in the realm of Forms. Knowledge consists fundamentally in perceiving the conformity (or extent of this conformity). <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=44&amp;annotation=4020R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=44&amp;annotation=4020R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=44&amp;annotation=4020R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.44</a>
<br>
As far as the mental states involved in the process of knowing are concerned, modern thinkers often tend to contrast knowledge with belief. This is possibly because knowing implies some kind of acceptance or assertion of a fact <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=44&amp;annotation=4023R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=44&amp;annotation=4023R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=44&amp;annotation=4023R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.44</a>
<br>
For Plato, as for anyone who overemphasizes the role of reason, knowledge is an individual intellectual state or act of recognition of the truth. Knowledge is all inside the head what lies outside in the material world are just the contingent, deceptive appearances of knowledge (See Stumpf &amp; Abel 2002:29-43) <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=44&amp;annotation=4026R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=44&amp;annotation=4026R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=44&amp;annotation=4026R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.44</a>
<br><br>
Like all good philosophers, Plato was quite critical of his own philosophy. Having anticipated weaknesses in his philosophy (which others, of course, were not slow to identify), Plato constantly subjected his philosophy to self-criticism. The main difficulties are to explain how the Forms are related to one another and to the particular things which exemplify them. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=45&amp;annotation=4029R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=45&amp;annotation=4029R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=45&amp;annotation=4029R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.45</a>
<br>
Another difficulty is to understand how things ‚Äúparticipate'' in the Forms <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=45&amp;annotation=4032R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=45&amp;annotation=4032R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=45&amp;annotation=4032R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.45</a>
<br>
Does it help to say that the particulars imitate or approximate to the Form? <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=45&amp;annotation=4035R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=45&amp;annotation=4035R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=45&amp;annotation=4035R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.45</a>
<br>
Should we not suppose yet another Form (as one term of the relation of similarity) and the first Form (as the other)? If so, we shall then be in need of yet another Form to explain the relation of the first (and the particulars) to the second, and so on indefinitely. This, in effect, is Aristotle's criticism, commonly known as ‚Äúthe third man argument‚Äù: if the Form of Man is the thing that all men resemble, is it not just another man? If it is not, how can men resemble it? <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=45&amp;annotation=4038R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=45&amp;annotation=4038R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=45&amp;annotation=4038R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.45</a>

<br><br>
It may have occurred to you that certain general terms are basically relational. For example, terms such as ‚Äútall‚Äù, ‚Äúshort‚Äù, ‚Äúheavy‚Äù, and ‚Äúlight‚Äù seem to have no absolute meaning, but imply some reference to a standard of comparison. Without such a reference the term is without meaning. There can be no Form of tallness, since if there were to be, the same individual would be ‚Äútall‚Äù when compared with one individual and ‚Äúshort‚Äù in comparison with another. Or consider a heap of salt. If one were to add a bit of salt to it, the heap would increase in size; but if one were to add a piece of ‚Äúsmallness‚Äù to something, that something would logically decrease in size. So one must either deny that relational qualities can possibly be Forms, or be led into contradiction <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=46&amp;annotation=4044R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=46&amp;annotation=4044R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=46&amp;annotation=4044R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.46</a>

A realist approach to universals, such as that taken by Plato, implies that classes are themselves objects of knowledge and completely independent of particulars as objects of knowledge. The difficulties encountered in explaining just how each can be equally legitimate objects of knowledge within the confines of a coherent epistemology suggest problems for the defense of a realist position on universals. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=46&amp;annotation=4055R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=46&amp;annotation=4055R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=46&amp;annotation=4055R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.46</a>

<br>This is firstly done by categorising all knowledge at its lowest level as contingent (undifferentiated and changing, e.g., plants), then universal or genus (qualities shared by a particular group e.g., trees) and finally essential or species (qualities uniquely specific e.g., oak trees that have acorns). Essential qualities answer the question why by establishing a chain of cause and effect reasoning. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=46&amp;annotation=4064R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=46&amp;annotation=4064R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=46&amp;annotation=4064R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.46</a>

A solution to the problem we have been examining was suggested by Plato's famous student, Aristotle (384-322 BCE). Aristotle agrees with Plato that the ever-changing particulars cannot be objects of knowledge as particulars, but he thinks that sense perception can, and indeed must, play a part in the acquisition of knowledge <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=46&amp;annotation=4070R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=46&amp;annotation=4070R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=46&amp;annotation=4070R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.46</a>
<br>
Aristotle does not think that Forms can exist independently of particulars. The relationship between them is not comparable to the relationship between an object and its shadow. He thinks that Forms and particulars are interdependent; in other words, neither can exist without the other. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=47&amp;annotation=4073R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=47&amp;annotation=4073R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=47&amp;annotation=4073R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.47</a>
<br>
Moreover, Aristotle does not believe that our knowledge of Forms is innate, depending on recollection from an existence in the world of Forms <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=47&amp;annotation=4076R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=47&amp;annotation=4076R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=47&amp;annotation=4076R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.47</a>
<br>
Aristotle's thought, sense perception is not just an aid it plays an essential role. According to Aristotle (1953:13), ‚Äúthe act of sense perception is of the particular but its content is Universal''. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=47&amp;annotation=4079R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=47&amp;annotation=4079R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=47&amp;annotation=4079R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.47</a>
<br>
An established hierarchy of Forms gives us a classifying scheme and any Form can be defined by its place in the scheme. The lowest Form is a species, which is contained within a higher Form, its genus. A species is distinguished from other species in the genus by its unique and essential characteristics. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=47&amp;annotation=4082R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=47&amp;annotation=4082R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=47&amp;annotation=4082R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.47</a>
<br>
As mentioned earlier, an important feature of Aristotle's scheme of classification and of knowledge is that it is only possible to have knowledge of Forms, not of the particulars which make up the species. This is because particulars cannot be defined. To appreciate this we must understand the difference between a definition and a description. A particular can be described and identified, but it cannot be defined. That is, there are no properties which are essential to it as a particular, no properties which are required to make it the particular object which it is. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=47&amp;annotation=4085R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=47&amp;annotation=4085R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=47&amp;annotation=4085R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.47</a>
<br><br>
The classificatory scheme of knowledge devised by Aristotle can be more fully explained if one considers various examples. Let us first consider geometrical figures. One must appreciate that defining properties (or attributes) are essential to a geometrical figure being that figure, and that further properties can be logically deduced from these essential attributes <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=47&amp;annotation=4088R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=47&amp;annotation=4088R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=47&amp;annotation=4088R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.47</a>
<br>
Aristotle does not think that it is impossible to discover these essential attributes. He appreciates that we cannot start by defining an existent species in the way that we can define a mythical creature like a winged horse, but he thinks that there is a defining attribute (or, sometimes, a set of defining attributes), and by observing the particular individuals, this defining attribute can be discovered. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=48&amp;annotation=4091R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=48&amp;annotation=4091R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=48&amp;annotation=4091R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.48</a>
<br>
This process of generalizing, that is, making general assertions about properties by appealing to evidence from observation of particulars, is known as induction <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=48&amp;annotation=4094R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=48&amp;annotation=4094R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=48&amp;annotation=4094R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.48</a>
<br>
It is only if causal connection can be established that it becomes justifiable to assert that a property is essential and therefore necessary. Having shown a causal connection, a plain fact becomes a reasoned fact. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=48&amp;annotation=4097R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=48&amp;annotation=4097R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=48&amp;annotation=4097R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.48</a>
<br>Aristotle (1953:93a 16; 93a 3) emphasised that we have to observe the plain fact in order to be able to show that it is a reasoned fact, although the fact and its reason may be apprehended simultaneously:<br>
When we are aware of a fact we seek its reason and though sometimes the fact and reason dawn upon us simultaneously, yet we cannot apprehend the reason a moment sooner than the fact; and clearly in just the same way we cannot apprehend a thing's definable Form without apprehending that it exists, since while we are ignorant whether it exists we cannot know its essential nature. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=48&amp;annotation=4105R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=48&amp;annotation=4105R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=48&amp;annotation=4105R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.48</a>
Moreover we are aware whether a thing exists or not sometimes through apprehending an element in its character, and sometimes accidentally, as, for example, when we are aware of thunder as a voice in the clouds ... As often we have accidental knowledge that the thing exists, we must be in a wholly negative state as regards awareness of its essential nature; for we have not got genuine knowledge even of its existence, ... the degree of our knowledge of a thing's essential nature is determined by the sense in which we are aware that it exists ... (And) to know its essential nature is, as we have said, to know the cause of a thing's existence, and the proof of this depends on the fact that a thing must have a cause. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=49&amp;annotation=4108R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4108R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4108R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.49</a>
<br>
Aristotle's answer to the question about how we know that we have indeed obtained knowledge and a true understanding of reasoned fact is that we know this by intuition or what he called nous. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=49&amp;annotation=4111R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4111R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4111R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.49</a>
<br>
Nous is a superior kind of apprehension. It is more reliable than deduced, scientific knowledge, since truth is known directly. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=49&amp;annotation=4114R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4114R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4114R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.49</a>
<br><br>At this stage a summary of the important features of Aristotle's analysis of knowledge may be helpful:<br>

<br>Like Plato, Aristotle was a realist; the Forms have an objective existence about which he was as sure as he was of the existence of physical objects <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=49&amp;annotation=4117R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4117R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4117R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.49</a>
<br>Unlike Plato, Aristotle believes that Forms cannot exist without particulars: they are interdependent. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=49&amp;annotation=4120R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4120R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4120R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.49</a>
<br>For Plato, knowledge can only be gained by recollecting the Forms which the mind had known in its pre-bodily existence. For Aristotle, knowledge is gained with the help of the sense perception of particulars. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=49&amp;annotation=4123R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4123R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4123R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.49</a>
<br>All Forms have necessary attributes which define them and on the basis of which (along with their relations to other Forms) their properties can be logically deduced. Observation helps us to discover essential properties by showing the plain facts of association of properties. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=49&amp;annotation=4126R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4126R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4126R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.49</a>
<br>Nous (intuition) reveals causes of associations and therefore reveals reasoned facts. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=49&amp;annotation=4129R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4129R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4129R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.49</a>
<br>Reasoned facts are the basis of scientific knowledge and further scientific knowledge is reached by deduction. This knowledge is necessary it cannot be otherwise <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=49&amp;annotation=4132R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4132R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4132R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.49</a>
<br>Empirical inquiry (inquiry into the world as we perceive it), therefore, can give us knowledge which is as certain as mathematical knowledge <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=49&amp;annotation=4135R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4135R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4135R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.49</a>

<br>
As far as the relationship between knowledge, truth, belief, and justification are concerned, Aristotle accepted the general conditions that knowledge was connected to truth, to belief, and to justification <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=49&amp;annotation=4138R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4138R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=49&amp;annotation=4138R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.49</a>
<br>
Aristotle places great emphasis upon the other two conditions. Truth, for him, is not the faithfulness of an entity to a general type or Form, which reason allows us all, in some degree, to perceive. Knowing is not recognizing, in an internal act, that something is a fairly faithful representation of its type. In a well-known passage of his Metaphysics Aristotle writes that ‚Äúto speak the truth is simply to say of what is, that it is, or of what is not, that it is not; and to speak falsely is to say of what is, that it is not, or of what is not, that it is''.<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=50&amp;annotation=4141R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=50&amp;annotation=4141R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=50&amp;annotation=4141R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.50</a>
<br>
Aristotle also pays close attention to justification. He emphasizes the need for extensive and careful observation, and places a high value on the tireless investigation of scientific matters, an investigation which, in principle, might be never-ending since new evidence is always coming to light. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=50&amp;annotation=4144R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=50&amp;annotation=4144R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=50&amp;annotation=4144R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.50</a>
<br><br>
<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=51&amp;annotation=4147R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=51&amp;annotation=4147R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=51&amp;annotation=4147R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">How do you think we can know that we have indeed found a true definition and a true cause (‚Äúreasoned fact'')? How does Aristotle explain the transition from plain fact to reasoned fact?</a>
<br><br>
When we are aware of a fact we seek its reason and, although sometimes the fact and reason dawn upon us simultaneously, yet we cannot apprehend the reason a moment sooner than the fact; clearly, in the same way, we cannot apprehend a thing's definable Form without apprehending that it exists since, while we are ignorant of its existence, we obviously cannot know its essential nature. Moreover, we are aware whether a thing exists or not sometimes through apprehending an element in its character, and sometimes accidentally, as, for example, when we are aware of thunder as a voice in the clouds. Since we often have only accidental knowledge that the thing exists, we must be in a wholly negative state about our awareness of its essential nature; for we have no genuine knowledge even of the thing's existence. The degree of our knowledge of a thing's essential nature is determined by the sense in which we are aware that it exists. And to know its essential nature is to know the cause of a thing's existence, and the proof of this depends on the fact that a thing must have a cause. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=51&amp;annotation=4150R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=51&amp;annotation=4150R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=51&amp;annotation=4150R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.51</a>
<br><br>
For Plato the ultimate real features of the universe are the Forms; for Aristotle they are the individual things that make up the world. Which view do you think is correct and why? <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=51&amp;annotation=4153R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=51&amp;annotation=4153R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=51&amp;annotation=4153R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.51</a>
<br><br>
As a pointer to a response to this complex question, one might suggest the following. One could argue that neither is correct that talk about ‚Äúthe ultimate real features of the universe'' is idle, etcetera but that would not be a philosophical answer. Clearly some (brief) exposition of both Plato's and Aristotle's metaphysical views is required, together with critical evaluation of the limitations of each. That would be the correct interpretation and response to this somewhat difficult question. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=51&amp;annotation=4156R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=51&amp;annotation=4156R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=51&amp;annotation=4156R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.51</a>
<br><br>
There are, according to Aristotle, four general kinds of cause which may operate in determinative way on anything, or be given in answer to the question of what something is, or why something is the case. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=51&amp;annotation=4159R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=51&amp;annotation=4159R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=51&amp;annotation=4159R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.51</a>
<br>
The material cause of anything is the stuff of which it is composed, its constituent matter. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=51&amp;annotation=4162R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=51&amp;annotation=4162R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=51&amp;annotation=4162R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.51</a>
<br>
The second kind of cause Aristotle identified is usually referred to as the formal cause. Here we have to do with the shape, pattern, composition or structure of something. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=52&amp;annotation=4165R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=52&amp;annotation=4165R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=52&amp;annotation=4165R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.52</a>
<br>
Form is always distinguishable from matter. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=52&amp;annotation=4168R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=52&amp;annotation=4168R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=52&amp;annotation=4168R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.52</a>

The third cause is dynamic and distinguishable from its object. It is the efficient or motive cause the initiator of the process by which something comes into being, sometimes natural, sometimes involving a deliberate action. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=52&amp;annotation=4171R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=52&amp;annotation=4171R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=52&amp;annotation=4171R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.52</a>

The fourth Aristotelian cause is the final cause. This is the goal or end of anything; in other words, for the sake of which something occurs. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=52&amp;annotation=4174R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=52&amp;annotation=4174R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=52&amp;annotation=4174R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.52</a>

Material cause: a motor car tire is made of rubber with chemical additives, sometimes with steel wire reinforcing, and a steel rim. 
Formal cause: a motor car tire is patterned on a circle, about 20 centimeters deep, with a textured surface. 
Efficient cause: a motor car tire is produced by melting and molding rubber. 
Final cause: a motor car tire is aimed at producing a safe, smooth car/road interface. Something of this sort would have done.

Aristotle sees knowledge as an ordinary matter which is within the grasp of all those who take enough pains to observe the world around them. It is not, as Plato believed, a mystical communion with ghostly Forms that only the exceptionally gifted person, the Philosopher-King, blessed with Reason in the highest degree can achieve in full, and which most ordinary people are destined never to have. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=52&amp;annotation=4188R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=52&amp;annotation=4188R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=52&amp;annotation=4188R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.52</a>
<br>
Can we understand everything, then? Yes, says Aristotle, except those things which happen by accident and are not determined by causal laws <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=53&amp;annotation=4191R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4191R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4191R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.53</a>
<br>
That which happens by chance does not happen in accordance with a causal law, and is not knowable in the full sense because we cannot understand or explain it we just observe it uncomprehendingly. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=53&amp;annotation=4194R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4194R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4194R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.53</a>
<br>
The second point to be made about this doctrine is that it goes hand in hand with a particular theory of what there is (ie a metaphysics). Observable causal relations are the route to knowledge, the objects of knowledge being the things that are fixed by those relations, and these things are ordinary physical objects like tables, cats, and cups <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=53&amp;annotation=4197R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4197R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4197R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.53</a>
<br>
There is no hierarchy of being with Forms at the top and physical objects at the bottom, as we find in Plato. The physical objects of knowledge are all there is. For Plato, ‚Äúthe real'' is identical with ‚Äúthe true''; reality is the supersensible world of Forms accessible only to the faculty of reason. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=53&amp;annotation=4200R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4200R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4200R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.53</a>

Summarizing his four causes Aristotle notes that ‚Äúall things that come to be come to be by some agency and from something, and come to be something''. He goes on to elaborate his notion that form and matter never exist separately. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=53&amp;annotation=4203R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4203R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4203R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.53</a>

Aristotle indicates that change does not involve bringing together formless matter with matter-less form. On the contrary, change occurs always in, and to, something that is already a combination of form and matter and that is on its way to becoming something new or different. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=53&amp;annotation=4206R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4206R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4206R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.53</a>
<br>
According to Aristotle, matter is potentiality and form is actualized matter. In contradiction to Plato's dualism whose substances are Forms, of which the phenomena of the world are mere imitations <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=53&amp;annotation=4209R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4209R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4209R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.53</a>
<br>
All things, says Aristotle, are involved in processes of change. Each thing possesses a power to become what its form has set as its end. There is, in all things, a dynamic power of striving toward their ‚Äúend" <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=53&amp;annotation=4212R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4212R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=53&amp;annotation=4212R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.53</a>

This self-contained end of anything Aristotle called its entelechy.

Aristotle saw the visible world as one composed of things in motion.

How does Aristotle's theory of reality (metaphysics) clarify this issue?</a>
<br><br>
Aristotle draws a distinction between matter and form. According to Aristotle, matter is potentiality and form is actualized matter. He believes that the particular substances are first substances in which through their form the universal is expressed. The first substances are thus real they are the foundations of experience, without which the universal could not be understood. Each thing possesses a power to become what its form has set as its end. There is, in all things, a dynamic power of striving toward their ‚Äúend.'' Some of this striving is toward external objects, such as when a man builds a house. But there is also the striving to achieve ends that reveal one's internal nature, such as when a person fulfils her nature as a person by the act of thinking. This self-contained end of anything Aristotle called its entelechy. Substances are beings which have fulfilled their entelechies. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=54&amp;annotation=4235R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=54&amp;annotation=4235R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=54&amp;annotation=4235R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.54</a>
<br><br>
For Aristotle, the Unmoved Mover does not mean the same thing as a first mover, as though motion could be traced back to a time when motion began. Nor is the Unmoved Mover considered by him a creator in the sense of later theology.  <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=54&amp;annotation=4238R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=54&amp;annotation=4238R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=54&amp;annotation=4238R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.54</a>

Aristotle introduces the notion of the Unmoved Mover as the ‚Äúreason for'' or the ‚Äúprinciple of '' motion.

By being a final cause, the Unmoved Mover thereby, in relation to the world, becomes also efficient cause through the power of attraction, by inspiring the striving towards natural ends, a process that goes on eternally.

Both the rationalist Descartes and the empiricist Locke regarded mathematical knowledge as the paradigm of knowledge. It was the paradigm of knowledge because mathematical knowledge could be arrived at by deduction from the defining (and therefore the essential) properties of mathematical entities. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=55&amp;annotation=4253R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=55&amp;annotation=4253R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=55&amp;annotation=4253R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.55</a>

Systems of classifications may help scientists to discover unknown species. Observation of properties of chemical elements led to creation of the periodic table, an extremely successful classificatory device. When it was first proposed, in 1869, the periodic table was, like classifications of plant and animal life, based on empirical facts, not on reasoned facts. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=55&amp;annotation=4256R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=55&amp;annotation=4256R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=55&amp;annotation=4256R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.55</a>

Neither Plato nor Aristotle considered the possibility that different kinds of knowledge, that is, knowledge about different kinds of objects (mathematical entities as opposed to empirical facts) might be justified in different ways. For them, all knowledge had to be logically necessary and beyond any doubt. For Plato, the objects of knowledge were Forms, intuitively apprehended by mental contemplation. For Aristotle, there could only be knowledge of existing entities in so far as the properties of a species (their universal attributes) are concerned. So to have knowledge (nous) of the ‚ÄúEvil Eye'', of the black cat, would be identical to linking various particular and evident facts seeing the universal (catness) in that particular cat <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=56&amp;annotation=4259R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=56&amp;annotation=4259R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=56&amp;annotation=4259R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.56</a>

Are classifying schemes merely devices for grouping entities together on the basis of certain property(ies) which they happen to have in common? If they are, the association of these properties is a contingent association, not a necessary association. Is essential knowledge still possible? 
Do you agree with Aristotle that scientific laws embody logically necessary truth? <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=56&amp;annotation=4262R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=56&amp;annotation=4262R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=56&amp;annotation=4262R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.56</a>

Aristotle did not consider the possibility that different kinds of knowledge, that is, knowledge about different kinds of objects (mathematical entities as opposed to empirical facts) might be justified in different ways. For him, all knowledge had to be logically necessary and beyond any doubt. Before Hume (1711-1776), Aristotle and the philosophers and scientists who came after him continued to believe in the possibility of discovering the true causes of physical events. Aristotle thought that this would provide the logically necessary connection between events. He believed that this logically necessary connection must be deduced from intuitively self-evident premises, and, taking this as his starting point, he explored nature, developing his theory of the four causes as a consequence of his view of logical necessity. But modern scientists are unanimous in siding with Hume against Aristotle on this matter. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=56&amp;annotation=4265R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=56&amp;annotation=4265R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=56&amp;annotation=4265R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.56</a>

We suggest you treat these questions as a kind of revision exercise. Please note that many of them are not intended to be examples of questions which may be set in your examinations. Instead, they should be regarded as drawing attention to parts of the study material which require further consolidation and reflection. After formulating your responses to these questions, you should be in a better position to develop your ideas in the systematic manner required to answer the longer, essay-type examination questions. You will receive some examples of examination questions in the follow-up tutorial letters which will be sent to you some time after the assignment closing dates <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf > page=57&amp;annotation=4283R" data-href="PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=57&amp;annotation=4283R" href=".\https:\\unisa.trap.lol\90180\firstlevel\pls1501\externalMaterial\tut\2023\PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=57&amp;annotation=4283R" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">p.57</a>

Westman, Claire : "What's important is that you not think of philosophy as just a subject." : (00:05:47.198)
Westman, Claire : "That you're going to study here and never use again and it's going to have no value" : (00:05:52.038)
Westman, Claire : "for your studies or your life." : (00:05:56.658)
Westman, Claire : "The skills and the reasoning abilities that you're going to develop," : (00:05:58.548)
Westman, Claire : "the argumentation skills that you're going to develop are very necessary parts" : (00:06:03.111)
Westman, Claire : "of our lives, and in reading through the reflections" : (00:06:08.334)
Westman, Claire : "that some of you have done already on the site," : (00:06:11.839)
Westman, Claire : "I've seen some really good answers and some." : (00:06:15.013)
Westman, Claire : "Really." : (00:06:17.988)
Westman, Claire : "Good thinking around what you already know about philosophy." : (00:06:19.318)
Westman, Claire : "So if you haven't done that already, I mean it's just for you to do as a" : (00:06:23.228)
Westman, Claire : "little extra exercise, but it's a great way for you to." : (00:06:28.502)
Westman, Claire : "Start the module to think about what do you know about philosophy." : (00:06:34.118)
Westman, Claire : "What does philosophy mean to you?" : (00:06:37.118)
Westman, Claire : "How is it going to help in your studies in your life?" : (00:06:39.118)
Westman, Claire : "And I've seen some really great responses, so I'm really excited to see that some of" : (00:06:42.638)
Westman, Claire : "you already have an idea of what philosophy is about, but more importantly," : (00:06:48.993)
Westman, Claire : "how many of you have noted that philosophy is an important part of our" : (00:06:54.674)
Westman, Claire : "everyday lives? So we engage in Phil." : (00:06:59.982)
Westman, Claire : "Thinking and philosophical reasoning without even realizing that we're doing" : (00:07:02.908)
Westman, Claire : "it most of the time so." : (00:07:07.898)
Westman, Claire : "Every day we engage in philosophical thought without knowing that you're doing" : (00:07:10.958)
Westman, Claire : "it." : (00:07:14.735)
Westman, Claire : "And then once we once you've been doing philosophy for a bit of time," : (00:07:15.078)
Westman, Claire : "once you've done this module while you're working through the module." : (00:07:18.813)
Westman, Claire : "Those critical thinking and reasoning skills are going to develop even further," : (00:07:24.118)
Westman, Claire : "and you're going to gain a greater awareness of how valuable philosophy and" : (00:07:29.138)
Westman, Claire : "philosophical thinking is in everything you do." : (00:07:33.906)
Westman, Claire : "So it involves. Why do we make the choices we make?" : (00:07:36.918)
Westman, Claire : "Why do we have the beliefs that we have?" : (00:07:40.838)
Westman, Claire : "How do you gain knowledge of the world?" : (00:07:43.398)
Westman, Claire : "How can you understand the world and others better?" : (00:07:45.958)
Westman, Claire : "What is your place in the world?" : (00:07:49.718)
Westman, Claire : "And these might seem like a very big questions." : (00:07:53.148)
Westman, Claire : "And they can be." : (00:07:57.878)
Westman, Claire : "And often you will." : (00:07:58.518)
Westman, Claire : "You'll never might not ever get an specific answer to them." : (00:07:58.878)
Westman, Claire : "But the point is to be reflective to think about these things." : (00:08:02.798)
Westman, Claire : "It's so important because very often we make choices or we have beliefs," : (00:08:06.118)
Westman, Claire : "but we don't really think about why we make those choices or why we have those" : (00:08:11.228)
Westman, Claire : "beliefs or why we do the things that we do." : (00:08:16.758)
Westman, Claire : "And so philosophy fee is about think is about developing that reflective nature." : (00:08:20.518)
Westman, Claire : "That helps us to." : (00:08:28.798)
Westman, Claire : "Be more intentional about our thoughts and be more conscious of those choices we" : (00:08:31.678)
Westman, Claire : "make and of those decisions and of the ways we are in the world and the kinds of" : (00:08:37.530)
Westman, Claire : "things we the way we gain knowledge, the way we understand the world." : (00:08:43.381)
Westman, Claire : "So you will see that the big questions and a lot of the times as you're doing" : (00:08:48.718)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy, sometimes you will see that your beliefs" : (00:08:54.035)
Westman, Claire : "and your opinions and your ideas and the way you think about yourself and the" : (00:08:57.647)
Westman, Claire : "world and others can start to change. And that's a." : (00:09:02.964)
Westman, Claire : "Good thing we all need to be reflective of who we are and how we behave and how" : (00:09:06.508)
Westman, Claire : "we act in this world, so hopefully that is something that" : (00:09:11.672)
Westman, Claire : "you're going to gain from this module." : (00:09:15.415)
Westman, Claire : "So philosophy can help to guide our well us to think about the questions." : (00:09:18.878)
Westman, Claire : "That guide our lives that can help us to think about the ways or reflect on the" : (00:09:25.838)
Westman, Claire : "ways in which we interact with others, the kinds of meaning we assign to our own" : (00:09:30.417)
Westman, Claire : "lives and the way in which we view not only our place in the world, but also." : (00:09:35.054)
Westman, Claire : "The value and meaning to be assigned to the world around us." : (00:09:39.558)
Westman, Claire : "So here you might even think about the meanings and value you assigned to" : (00:09:42.598)
Westman, Claire : "animals or to nature and the way you interact with that and the way you exist" : (00:09:47.580)
Westman, Claire : "in the world so." : (00:09:52.831)
Westman, Claire : "They're very, very big concept and big questions and" : (00:09:55.478)
Westman, Claire : "conflicts very complex at times and they can challenge your thinking." : (00:09:58.805)
Westman, Claire : "They can challenge the way." : (00:10:03.588)
Westman, Claire : "You feel about others the way you think about yourselves," : (00:10:07.238)
Westman, Claire : "about the meaning of your own life, but that is the whole point of philosophy," : (00:10:10.352)
Westman, Claire : "and that is what I hope that you're going to start to develop as you work through" : (00:10:14.592)
Westman, Claire : "this module." : (00:10:18.994)
Westman, Claire : "So yeah, I'm really glad that some of a lot of you" : (00:10:21.318)
Westman, Claire : "have already done the reflections. It's given me a good insight into where" : (00:10:23.994)
Westman, Claire : "you are at this point and what you already know and what you already think" : (00:10:27.930)
Westman, Claire : "about philosophy." : (00:10:31.866)
Westman, Claire : "Thank you for everyone that has done that. So specifically in this module," : (00:10:33.148)
Westman, Claire : "these are some of the questions we're going to ask." : (00:10:37.235)
Westman, Claire : "What can we know?" : (00:10:40.268)
Westman, Claire : "How do we gain knowledge?" : (00:10:41.588)
Westman, Claire : "So for example, some philosophers say that we knowledge" : (00:10:43.308)
Westman, Claire : "is only gained through rationality or using reason." : (00:10:47.731)
Westman, Claire : "Aristotle would say that it's through experience." : (00:10:51.839)
Westman, Claire : "So how do we get that knowledge?" : (00:10:56.108)
Westman, Claire : "Then we're also going to ask things like in terms of ethics," : (00:10:58.798)
Westman, Claire : "how do we know what is right and wrong?" : (00:11:01.677)
Westman, Claire : "How do we make decisions about that?" : (00:11:03.908)
Westman, Claire : "What is justice?" : (00:11:07.838)
Westman, Claire : "What form of government is best?" : (00:11:09.078)
Westman, Claire : "What does it mean to be a social animal?" : (00:11:10.838)
Westman, Claire : "So what does it mean to be a person in a social setting?" : (00:11:13.758)
Westman, Claire : "What does it mean to live in a world with others with nature, with?" : (00:11:17.638)
Westman, Claire : "You know, with animals, with ancestors, what does it just mean to be a person in" : (00:11:23.838)
Westman, Claire : "the world?" : (00:11:27.683)
Westman, Claire : "So these are some of the main questions that we're going to ask as we work" : (00:11:28.478)
Westman, Claire : "through this module and I hope as I said that it's going to stimulate your own" : (00:11:33.615)
Westman, Claire : "thoughts and you're going to see how this relates to your life," : (00:11:39.025)
Westman, Claire : "to your everyday experiences, the quest." : (00:11:43.409)
Westman, Claire : "You have about the world, about your life, about others," : (00:11:46.388)
Westman, Claire : "and about how you are living." : (00:11:49.994)
Westman, Claire : "So the main outcomes, as we've already said," : (00:11:54.388)
Westman, Claire : "obviously one of the most important things that we need you to want you to" : (00:11:57.247)
Westman, Claire : "achieve by the end of the module is to understand the theoretical frameworks" : (00:12:02.013)
Westman, Claire : "that we will be looking at, such as epistemology, metaphysics, ethics," : (00:12:06.905)
Westman, Claire : "etcetera." : (00:12:11.416)
Westman, Claire : "And very, very very importantly, as a student," : (00:12:13.918)
Westman, Claire : "as a person in the world is to develop those critical thinking and reasoning" : (00:12:16.688)
Westman, Claire : "skills." : (00:12:21.226)
Westman, Claire : "Then by the end of the module, you will hopefully have enhanced your" : (00:12:22.638)
Westman, Claire : "skills for developing philosophical arguments," : (00:12:27.119)
Westman, Claire : "considering counter arguments and not just looking at one side of the argument." : (00:12:30.172)
Westman, Claire : "But it's always important to consider what the other side of the argument might" : (00:12:35.368)
Westman, Claire : "be." : (00:12:40.563)
Westman, Claire : "What might other people say about this idea or notion? How do these?" : (00:12:40.758)
Westman, Claire : "Interact with each other." : (00:12:48.278)
Westman, Claire : "What are the strengths and weaknesses of different arguments," : (00:12:49.558)
Westman, Claire : "and how does that help you to reach a conclusion or to develop your own" : (00:12:53.459)
Westman, Claire : "argument and then obviously as you go through the module, you're going to?" : (00:12:57.989)
Westman, Claire : "Begin to understand and develop more complex arguments of your own by drawing" : (00:13:04.598)
Westman, Claire : "on those theoretical frameworks by drawing on research and doing the" : (00:13:09.778)
Westman, Claire : "readings throughout the module throughout the semester." : (00:13:14.360)
Westman, Claire : "So that is what the main things that we hope you're going to be able to achieve" : (00:13:18.888)
Westman, Claire : "by the time we reach the end of the semester." : (00:13:24.044)
Westman, Claire : "So in order to do that, it will be based on your readings on the" : (00:13:27.368)
Westman, Claire : "assignments that we give you on engaging in those discussion forums on thinking" : (00:13:32.113)
Westman, Claire : "about the work." : (00:13:37.953)
Westman, Claire : "So philosophy can be challenging." : (00:13:39.568)
Westman, Claire : "And I won't sugarcoat that it can be a challenging subject." : (00:13:44.198)
Westman, Claire : "It's a different way of reading, a different way of thinking." : (00:13:47.598)
Westman, Claire : "So a different way of writing a time so it can be complex," : (00:13:52.478)
Westman, Claire : "but I don't want you to go into this being scared of the module and thinking" : (00:13:55.898)
Westman, Claire : "it's something that's so out there and something that you've never engaged in." : (00:14:00.362)
Westman, Claire : "Like I said, it's something you do every." : (00:14:04.941)
Westman, Claire : "Day you just don't know that you do." : (00:14:07.318)
Westman, Claire : "And obviously when you're doing philosophy at university," : (00:14:09.798)
Westman, Claire : "it is more formal and you need to rely on." : (00:14:14.183)
Westman, Claire : "The text that you read, I'm doing research and developing your" : (00:14:18.518)
Westman, Claire : "arguments based on referenced and reasoned evidence." : (00:14:22.749)
Westman, Claire : "But it is something that you can do and we see that every year people do," : (00:14:28.838)
Westman, Claire : "you know, we come up with good arguments that" : (00:14:32.945)
Westman, Claire : "understand the theory." : (00:14:35.497)
Westman, Claire : "So I don't want you to go into the module feeling overwhelmed," : (00:14:36.718)
Westman, Claire : "which can happen with philosophy and obviously we are here to help you through" : (00:14:40.907)
Westman, Claire : "the semester, so please don't ever feel worried about" : (00:14:46.160)
Westman, Claire : "reaching out or concerned about posting on the forums that maybe people will you" : (00:14:49.750)
Westman, Claire : "know." : (00:14:55.136)
Westman, Claire : "Think it's a silly question." : (00:14:55.508)
Westman, Claire : "I can assure you any questions that you have somebody else in the module," : (00:14:57.748)
Westman, Claire : "somebody else is also doing. The module has and they will be very glad" : (00:15:01.960)
Westman, Claire : "that you've asked the question so that they can also find out." : (00:15:06.002)
Westman, Claire : "So please don't ever be afraid to reach out or to ask US questions." : (00:15:09.908)
Westman, Claire : "That is, the point is, we are here to help you," : (00:15:13.788)
Westman, Claire : "to get through this module and to hopefully enjoy the module." : (00:15:16.965)
Westman, Claire : "That's the main goal and to help you develop an interest or philosophy and to" : (00:15:21.068)
Westman, Claire : "want to continue on in philosophy." : (00:15:27.531)
Westman, Claire : "So please always reach out if you need us." : (00:15:30.348)
Westman, Claire : "So the prescribed books and reading there is no prescribed book for this module as" : (00:15:35.308)
Westman, Claire : "books." : (00:15:40.680)
Westman, Claire : "Sorry as you will have seen, if you've done the if you've looked" : (00:15:41.068)
Westman, Claire : "through the tutorial letter already." : (00:15:44.440)
Westman, Claire : "The main source for this module is the study guide," : (00:15:47.878)
Westman, Claire : "and if you haven't already downloaded or looked at the study guide," : (00:15:51.883)
Westman, Claire : "it's under the official study material link on the PLS 150125 S One site," : (00:15:57.121)
Westman, Claire : "so please go get that as soon as Poss." : (00:16:02.821)
Westman, Claire : "If you haven't already looked at it because you do need to read through that," : (00:16:05.948)
Westman, Claire : "at least the some of the units in order to answer the questions for assessment" : (00:16:11.045)
Westman, Claire : "one." : (00:16:16.207)
Westman, Claire : "So for your assessments and to prepare for the exam," : (00:16:18.038)
Westman, Claire : "you will use the study guide as your main source." : (00:16:21.208)
Westman, Claire : "But because you are now at university, we also expect you to do some of your own" : (00:16:24.558)
Westman, Claire : "research." : (00:16:30.282)
Westman, Claire : "So please." : (00:16:30.918)
Westman, Claire : "Please make sure you focus focus on the study guide," : (00:16:33.558)
Westman, Claire : "but do your own research if possible as well," : (00:16:36.698)
Westman, Claire : "because that is something that you need to start developing." : (00:16:39.424)
Westman, Claire : "Those skills you need to start thinking about what other sources say you need to" : (00:16:43.038)
Westman, Claire : "start bringing research into your work." : (00:16:47.837)
Westman, Claire : "So other than those, the other resources that you will use are" : (00:16:51.798)
Westman, Claire : "the tutorial letter 101." : (00:16:56.375)
Westman, Claire : "That obviously if you have looked at it already contains important administrative" : (00:16:58.438)
Westman, Claire : "information about the module." : (00:17:03.077)
Westman, Claire : "It gives you an overview of the module, so it's very important to go through that" : (00:17:05.028)
Westman, Claire : "to just have an understanding of the module." : (00:17:09.858)
Westman, Claire : "Then you will also find on the site tutorial letter 301 and this is also a" : (00:17:12.908)
Westman, Claire : "very important resource for when you're doing your assessments." : (00:17:17.505)
Westman, Claire : "This tutorial letter gives you guidelines for writing a philosophical essay and" : (00:17:23.238)
Westman, Claire : "very importantly for referencing." : (00:17:28.392)
Westman, Claire : "So remember that referencing is absolutely vital." : (00:17:31.118)
Westman, Claire : "Any assessment you submit in philosophy and in most other modules," : (00:17:37.028)
Westman, Claire : "but I want to speak for others." : (00:17:42.060)
Westman, Claire : "But any assessment you submit in philosophy has to include referenced" : (00:17:44.628)
Westman, Claire : "evidence." : (00:17:50.334)
Westman, Claire : "So you need to have an idea of how to reference so that tutorial letter gives" : (00:17:51.068)
Westman, Claire : "you gives explanations of how to reference." : (00:17:57.768)
Westman, Claire : "In your work OK." : (00:18:02.318)
Westman, Claire : "So very, very, very, very important." : (00:18:03.568)
Westman, Claire : "Then you also will get tutorial letters 2:01 and 2:02." : (00:18:07.638)
Westman, Claire : "Those are not on the site yet, because those are the follow up tutorial" : (00:18:11.558)
Westman, Claire : "letters for the assessments." : (00:18:15.590)
Westman, Claire : "So those act in a way as a kind of memo." : (00:18:17.358)
Westman, Claire : "Giving you guidelines for what should have been included in the assessments," : (00:18:22.358)
Westman, Claire : "how you could have approached the assessments," : (00:18:27.185)
Westman, Claire : "the kind of thing that we were looking for when we were marking your assessments," : (00:18:30.132)
Westman, Claire : "they won't give you exact answers because in philosophy they are an issue doing" : (00:18:35.272)
Westman, Claire : "critical, Phil." : (00:18:40.288)
Westman, Claire : "A critical reasoning." : (00:18:41.388)
Westman, Claire : "They are very specific answers, but in this module." : (00:18:42.348)
Westman, Claire : "They aren't right or wrong answers. The important point is that you" : (00:18:46.718)
Westman, Claire : "understand the theory that you are able to explain the theory comprehensively and." : (00:18:51.293)
Westman, Claire : "In a way that explain the theory properly and that you are able to develop an" : (00:19:01.598)
Westman, Claire : "argument." : (00:19:07.220)
Westman, Claire : "So if we ask you, for example, who do you agree with more Plato or" : (00:19:07.868)
Westman, Claire : "Aristotle?" : (00:19:13.472)
Westman, Claire : "Neither of those. If you said Plato, or if you said Aristotle." : (00:19:15.878)
Westman, Claire : "Neither of those answers are right or wrong." : (00:19:18.998)
Westman, Claire : "What we want to see is why you say that." : (00:19:21.358)
Westman, Claire : "How you support that answer?" : (00:19:24.038)
Westman, Claire : "How you develop your argument, how you make it clear why you are saying" : (00:19:26.598)
Westman, Claire : "that you, for example, agree with Plato's theory off the forms" : (00:19:31.556)
Westman, Claire : "rather than with Aristotle, OK." : (00:19:35.894)
Westman, Claire : "So you will never get one straightforward answer to the questions that are in your" : (00:19:38.028)
Westman, Claire : "assessments in those follow up tutorial letters." : (00:19:43.695)
Westman, Claire : "There will be guidelines of how you could have approached the question." : (00:19:47.040)
Westman, Claire : "The primary things that we were looking for." : (00:19:51.956)
Westman, Claire : "And how you could have drawn on that information and then closer to the exam," : (00:19:56.598)
Westman, Claire : "we will load some past exam papers." : (00:20:02.065)
Westman, Claire : "Again, these are just to help you and see what" : (00:20:05.828)
Westman, Claire : "kinds of questions might be asked in the exams. The way questions might be asked." : (00:20:09.748)
Westman, Claire : "Obviously that's not going to be the exact same questions in your exam," : (00:20:18.158)
Westman, Claire : "but just to give you an idea of what." : (00:20:22.042)
Westman, Claire : "A question what the questions are like in a philosophy exam," : (00:20:24.038)
Westman, Claire : "and once you see that then you can start to also think about how you will prepare" : (00:20:27.479)
Westman, Claire : "for the exam." : (00:20:32.105)
Westman, Claire : "So those will be loaded." : (00:20:32.878)
Westman, Claire : "Not right now." : (00:20:36.668)
Westman, Claire : "Because for now, we need you to focus on your assessments." : (00:20:37.348)
Westman, Claire : "So a little bit later in the semester, we will load those so that you can start" : (00:20:39.948)
Westman, Claire : "working through those." : (00:20:43.587)
Westman, Claire : "So then for this module, there are three assessments." : (00:20:47.308)
Westman, Claire : "There are two assignments and one exam, so you might have already seen this" : (00:20:51.428)
Westman, Claire : "information or do some of it in the tutorial letter and on the site," : (00:20:56.928)
Westman, Claire : "and these are the kinds of assessments when they do and the semester wait." : (00:21:01.921)
Westman, Claire : "So assessment one, you know a short answer questions." : (00:21:07.748)
Westman, Claire : "The due date is the 20th of March and it is out of 100." : (00:21:11.283)
Westman, Claire : "So what the semester wait means is that this assignment assessment 1 counts 20%" : (00:21:15.758)
Westman, Claire : "of your overall semester mark." : (00:21:23.256)
Westman, Claire : "So assessment one and assessment 2 together count 40% of your total semester" : (00:21:26.468)
Westman, Claire : "mark and your exam count 60%." : (00:21:34.401)
Westman, Claire : "So that's not something you need to worry about too much." : (00:21:38.958)
Westman, Claire : "It's just showing you that the exam has a slightly greater waiting than the other" : (00:21:42.877)
Westman, Claire : "assessments." : (00:21:48.417)
Westman, Claire : "But it's it's not something you really need to be stressed about." : (00:21:49.428)
Westman, Claire : "Just do your assessments as best as you can." : (00:21:52.988)
Westman, Claire : "Make sure that you submit assessment one and assessment 2." : (00:21:56.259)
Westman, Claire : "Both are mandatory for this module." : (00:22:00.908)
Westman, Claire : "So and if you submit only one of them, then you are likely not to do very well" : (00:22:04.638)
Westman, Claire : "overall in the semester. It will affect your overall grade." : (00:22:11.867)
Westman, Claire : "So it is mandatory that you do assessment one and two assessment 2 which is due on" : (00:22:17.948)
Westman, Claire : "the 25th of April is an essay question." : (00:22:24.153)
Westman, Claire : "And again, it's out of 100 and waiting of 20% and" : (00:22:28.638)
Westman, Claire : "then the exam will consist of short answers and an essay." : (00:22:32.194)
Westman, Claire : "So it will combine the kinds of questions you've been asked in assessment one and" : (00:22:36.318)
Westman, Claire : "assessment two and we can't give you the date for that yet because the exam" : (00:22:41.477)
Westman, Claire : "timetable is not out yet, but it is in May or June, yeah." : (00:22:46.259)
Westman, Claire : "So I've already received some questions about assessment one and I don't want to" : (00:22:50.268)
Westman, Claire : "go into too much detail about it now, but just to address the ones that I've" : (00:22:54.571)
Westman, Claire : "received a few questions about." : (00:22:58.661)
Westman, Claire : "One question was do you need introductions and conclusions?" : (00:23:01.878)
Westman, Claire : "It states very clearly in the assessment." : (00:23:04.598)
Westman, Claire : "Instructions do not include introductions or conclusions for assessment." : (00:23:07.438)
Westman, Claire : "One they are short answer questions." : (00:23:13.038)
Westman, Claire : "Each question has a word limit of 300 words, which might seem like a lot," : (00:23:16.198)
Westman, Claire : "but it is not. So if you including in an introduction" : (00:23:21.321)
Westman, Claire : "and a conclusion in those 300 words, you're not really going to have enough" : (00:23:25.059)
Westman, Claire : "space to get to the most important inform." : (00:23:30.321)
Westman, Claire : "So for assessment one, you just have to include." : (00:23:34.468)
Westman, Claire : "The what we would call the body of the answer, OK." : (00:23:40.318)
Westman, Claire : "So just include the most important information that's needed to answer the" : (00:23:42.878)
Westman, Claire : "question that's needed to help you develop your discussion or your argument," : (00:23:47.570)
Westman, Claire : "depending on what the question is. You do not need to include introductions" : (00:23:52.387)
Westman, Claire : "or conclusions for assessment one." : (00:23:57.141)
Westman, Claire : "Then I've had quite a few people emailing me about if they need a cover page." : (00:24:00.838)
Westman, Claire : "It is not compulsory to include a cover page." : (00:24:06.598)
Westman, Claire : "There's no mark for it, but it is good to get into the habit of" : (00:24:08.598)
Westman, Claire : "doing cover pages, so you are welcome to include a cover" : (00:24:13.291)
Westman, Claire : "page, but you won't be penalized if you don't." : (00:24:17.471)
Westman, Claire : "The same with the contents page. If you want to include a contents page," : (00:24:22.468)
Westman, Claire : "you're welcome to, but you will not lose marks if you don't" : (00:24:26.617)
Westman, Claire : "include one." : (00:24:30.026)
Westman, Claire : "Then people have asked me about the the font." : (00:24:32.278)
Westman, Claire : "So you can use one of the more academic fronts. One of the more formal fonts." : (00:24:35.878)
Westman, Claire : "So Calibri, aerial or times new Roman and I would" : (00:24:40.798)
Westman, Claire : "suggest size 11 or 12." : (00:24:46.159)
Westman, Claire : "Hard and fast rules about it, but size 10 can be difficult for us to" : (00:24:51.988)
Westman, Claire : "read." : (00:24:56.016)
Westman, Claire : "If you have challenges with your eyesight and you need to type in bigger font," : (00:24:57.878)
Westman, Claire : "then please do so absolutely, but otherwise stick to around size 11 or" : (00:25:03.637)
Westman, Claire : "12 and then again with line spacing." : (00:25:08.814)
Westman, Claire : "There are no specific rules about it, but it is easier for us to read when" : (00:25:11.878)
Westman, Claire : "we're marking. If your line spacing is 1 1/2 or two." : (00:25:16.706)
Westman, Claire : "Even so, those are just some of the general" : (00:25:20.118)
Westman, Claire : "guidelines for the more technical aspects of the assignment." : (00:25:23.785)
Westman, Claire : "Very, very important for the assignment." : (00:25:29.188)
Westman, Claire : "Remember to include your in text referencing and a bibliography." : (00:25:31.788)
Westman, Claire : "OK, so that is something that you must" : (00:25:37.598)
Westman, Claire : "include, but I'm not going to focus on the content" : (00:25:39.974)
Westman, Claire : "of the assessment right now." : (00:25:43.082)
Westman, Claire : "If you have questions about that, please do send them to me or post them on" : (00:25:46.438)
Westman, Claire : "the discussion forums and we can address them there as well." : (00:25:50.832)
Westman, Claire : "And then very importantly is that there are others resources that you can use in" : (00:25:56.118)
Westman, Claire : "order to help you with your assessments and in order to help you with your" : (00:26:00.832)
Westman, Claire : "studies, you have obviously access to the library," : (00:26:05.197)
Westman, Claire : "which is essential for your research and your studying a lot of." : (00:26:08.165)
Westman, Claire : "The information can be accessed online, so that's important." : (00:26:11.948)
Westman, Claire : "There are also librarians who can assist you," : (00:26:17.188)
Westman, Claire : "so please go look at the library web page and just play around on it to see what" : (00:26:20.323)
Westman, Claire : "information is on there, what resources are available to you." : (00:26:25.843)
Westman, Claire : "The contact numbers or e-mail addresses for people who work in the library that" : (00:26:31.638)
Westman, Claire : "can also assist you if you need any assistance and then very very," : (00:26:36.923)
Westman, Claire : "very beneficial are the online databases." : (00:26:41.350)
Westman, Claire : "These are very convenient and reliable way to access academic articles." : (00:26:45.598)
Westman, Claire : "I'm sure a lot of you don't know how to use the online databases at this stage." : (00:26:51.008)
Westman, Claire : "I'm going to make a video showing you the exact steps of how to access the online" : (00:26:57.018)
Westman, Claire : "databases, which I will load." : (00:27:03.179)
Westman, Claire : "Onto the site." : (00:27:05.358)
Westman, Claire : "Because when you are doing your assessments," : (00:27:07.068)
Westman, Claire : "you need to make sure that you are using reliable academic sources and the online" : (00:27:10.535)
Westman, Claire : "databases are probably the easiest way for you to go about finding good academic" : (00:27:16.852)
Westman, Claire : "sources." : (00:27:23.092)
Westman, Claire : "It's it contains thousands of journals." : (00:27:25.638)
Westman, Claire : "And articles and so when you go onto the databases once you know how to use them," : (00:27:30.118)
Westman, Claire : "it's a really, really great way to find those articles" : (00:27:36.242)
Westman, Claire : "that you can use as research that you can use for your assessments." : (00:27:40.350)
Westman, Claire : "So I will make a video for that. So please go watch that once I've loaded" : (00:27:45.588)
Westman, Claire : "it, I'll send out an announcement because" : (00:27:50.105)
Westman, Claire : "that will help you through the whole of your university career." : (00:27:52.668)
Westman, Claire : "You will need to know how to use slides. So if you don't already know." : (00:27:56.575)
Westman, Claire : "Some of you might." : (00:28:01.718)
Westman, Claire : "Then please go watch the video. Once I've done that." : (00:28:02.398)
Westman, Claire : "And then, of course, there are also many other student" : (00:28:06.328)
Westman, Claire : "resources which I'm sure you've been told about and alluded to by the university." : (00:28:09.636)
Westman, Claire : "So always just go look on the unisa page to see on Unisa website to see what other" : (00:28:15.368)
Westman, Claire : "resources are available for you, OK." : (00:28:21.227)
Westman, Claire : "And then so some of the expectations that we have for you as students in this" : (00:28:25.288)
Westman, Claire : "module very, very, very important is that you check the site" : (00:28:31.088)
Westman, Claire : "regularly." : (00:28:35.625)
Westman, Claire : "Sorry, it's just having especially the" : (00:28:38.518)
Westman, Claire : "announcements, important information is shared in those" : (00:28:41.430)
Westman, Claire : "announcements. So please check on their regularly to see" : (00:28:45.612)
Westman, Claire : "if there's any new information. All the resources that you need on that," : (00:28:49.868)
Westman, Claire : "the PLS 150125 is one site, so make sure that." : (00:28:55.319)
Westman, Claire : "You are very familiar with it." : (00:28:58.828)
Westman, Claire : "You know how to use it." : (00:29:00.588)
Westman, Claire : "You can access those resources if you have any issues with accessing the site." : (00:29:01.988)
Westman, Claire : "Please let us know as soon as possible so that we can assist you with that or put" : (00:29:06.895)
Westman, Claire : "you on to the people who can assist with that." : (00:29:11.989)
Westman, Claire : "You need to read all of your study materials very carefully." : (00:29:16.478)
Westman, Claire : "That includes a tutorial 101, the study guide." : (00:29:20.918)
Westman, Claire : "Tutorial 301 and then of course, once the tutorial 200 litres are out," : (00:29:25.068)
Westman, Claire : "you can also look through those." : (00:29:30.472)
Westman, Claire : "Very, very, very important is that you submit your" : (00:29:34.478)
Westman, Claire : "assessments before the due date." : (00:29:36.788)
Westman, Claire : "Or at least on the due date on the day that they're due." : (00:29:39.958)
Westman, Claire : "Do not wait until the last minute, though. Sometimes what happens is because" : (00:29:44.638)
Westman, Claire : "everybody's trying to submit assignments at the same time at 1059 minutes." : (00:29:49.420)
Westman, Claire : "During 11 the system crashes or you have technical challenges and then you don't" : (00:29:54.078)
Westman, Claire : "submit your assignment." : (00:29:59.616)
Westman, Claire : "Unless you have a very, very valid reason, for example universal bit," : (00:30:02.758)
Westman, Claire : "a death in the family, or an illness that you have a doctor's" : (00:30:07.961)
Westman, Claire : "note for." : (00:30:12.569)
Westman, Claire : "And that would have severely impacted on you submitting." : (00:30:15.788)
Westman, Claire : "We do not accept assignments by e-mail, OK." : (00:30:20.751)
Westman, Claire : "So you must make sure that you submit in time so that you can." : (00:30:24.583)
Westman, Claire : "Contact us if there are any challenges that you face or that you can." : (00:30:32.718)
Westman, Claire : "Submit, try again and submit again. If the system is down or anything like" : (00:30:38.038)
Westman, Claire : "that. OK, we know that there can be technical" : (00:30:42.288)
Westman, Claire : "challenges." : (00:30:44.895)
Westman, Claire : "We know in this country issues with network and load shedding," : (00:30:45.518)
Westman, Claire : "but your assignments are given to you while in advance," : (00:30:50.436)
Westman, Claire : "so they shouldn't really be any technical excuses." : (00:30:54.807)
Westman, Claire : "So generally we see those when people are trying to submit their watch, says 1058." : (00:30:59.468)
Westman, Claire : "But on the system it's 11/01 and the submission has closed OK." : (00:31:04.948)
Westman, Claire : "So please do not wait until the very last minute." : (00:31:09.588)
Westman, Claire : "So my suggestion is always try and submit." : (00:31:14.148)
Westman, Claire : "At least a day or two in advance, in case there are any challenges." : (00:31:17.358)
Westman, Claire : "If you can't do that, try at least submit a few hours before" : (00:31:21.954)
Westman, Claire : "the deadline. OK, so for for both your assessments," : (00:31:26.077)
Westman, Claire : "the deadline is 11 at night, but try and submit in advance of that." : (00:31:29.592)
Westman, Claire : "OK. And if you have challenges, please let us know as it says in the last" : (00:31:35.758)
Westman, Claire : "point, as soon as you possibly can, because if you come to us three weeks" : (00:31:40.610)
Westman, Claire : "later and say I couldn't submit assessment one because of whatever reason" : (00:31:45.461)
Westman, Claire : "it might be too late for us." : (00:31:50.312)
Westman, Claire : "To do anything about it, remember there are cut off dates as well" : (00:31:52.148)
Westman, Claire : "for us to submit marks to the to the university." : (00:31:56.372)
Westman, Claire : "They are." : (00:32:01.758)
Westman, Claire : "They are processes that we have to follow behind the scenes that sometimes mean" : (00:32:02.558)
Westman, Claire : "that there's no way that we can help you." : (00:32:06.604)
Westman, Claire : "So if you have any kinds of challenges, let us know straight away." : (00:32:08.758)
Westman, Claire : "As soon as you are possible so that we can see how best we can help you. OK," : (00:32:13.300)
Westman, Claire : "engage in the online activities and discussions which a lot of you have" : (00:32:18.519)
Westman, Claire : "already been doing, which is amazing." : (00:32:23.400)
Westman, Claire : "The some of you have been doing the introductions and I always love the" : (00:32:25.988)
Westman, Claire : "introductions because it's very difficult to get to know you when we are in this" : (00:32:30.476)
Westman, Claire : "online environment." : (00:32:35.524)
Westman, Claire : "So the introductions are one way that I can get to know you that the other people" : (00:32:36.708)
Westman, Claire : "you are studying with can get to know a little bit about you." : (00:32:41.104)
Westman, Claire : "So thank you to everyone who's been doing the introductions." : (00:32:44.588)
Westman, Claire : "I've been reading through them as they've been coming up," : (00:32:47.628)
Westman, Claire : "obviously won't respond to all of them, but I'm very grateful for those of you" : (00:32:50.636)
Westman, Claire : "who have been doing them as well As for those of you who have been doing the" : (00:32:54.733)
Westman, Claire : "reflections." : (00:32:58.726)
Westman, Claire : "But what's very important about the activities in this discussions is they" : (00:33:00.918)
Westman, Claire : "can help you to improve your understanding there." : (00:33:05.808)
Westman, Claire : "A place where you can raise any questions or concerns that you have and it also" : (00:33:09.068)
Westman, Claire : "helps us as the PLS 1501 team to see what areas." : (00:33:14.283)
Westman, Claire : "We might need to assist with what areas need more attention," : (00:33:17.478)
Westman, Claire : "what parts of the module the content of the module." : (00:33:21.964)
Westman, Claire : "Are you struggling with that?" : (00:33:25.788)
Westman, Claire : "Need more attention?" : (00:33:26.948)
Westman, Claire : "How can we help you better in the module?" : (00:33:28.068)
Westman, Claire : "So those discussions are a way for us to also help you and then prepare for and" : (00:33:32.318)
Westman, Claire : "attend." : (00:33:38.599)
Westman, Claire : "Oh, if you're not able to attend, catch up on the discussion classes or the" : (00:33:40.628)
Westman, Claire : "recorded lessons. And when we have these discussion classes." : (00:33:45.221)
Westman, Claire : "So from next week on, we'll be having them regularly and we'll" : (00:33:48.908)
Westman, Claire : "be looking at the content of the module." : (00:33:53.263)
Westman, Claire : "Please prepare in advance by reading through the relevant section." : (00:33:56.468)
Westman, Claire : "That or relevant material that we will be focusing on in the discussion session." : (00:34:00.668)
Westman, Claire : "In those discussion classes, I will not be repeating everything that's" : (00:34:05.998)
Westman, Claire : "in the study guide, right?" : (00:34:10.441)
Westman, Claire : "Because the study guide is there for you to read it," : (00:34:12.068)
Westman, Claire : "so I'm not going to just repeat what's in there. That would be boring for you." : (00:34:14.558)
Westman, Claire : "It would not be super helpful." : (00:34:18.268)
Westman, Claire : "There will be an overview of the unit." : (00:34:21.598)
Westman, Claire : "There will be an overview of the content, but much more importantly," : (00:34:23.158)
Westman, Claire : "there a chance for you to ask questions about the content to gain clarification" : (00:34:28.005)
Westman, Claire : "on anything that is unclear to you. Their chance for us to engage with each" : (00:34:33.625)
Westman, Claire : "other for you to develop a deeper understanding stand." : (00:34:38.964)
Westman, Claire : "Off the content. So if you attend the discussion class and" : (00:34:42.828)
Westman, Claire : "you haven't read anything and you have no idea what we're talking about," : (00:34:46.503)
Westman, Claire : "they will not be as beneficial for you as if you prepare in advance." : (00:34:51.050)
Westman, Claire : "Because if you already have some kind of idea of what we're talking about," : (00:34:55.468)
Westman, Claire : "you'll be able to focus more during the discussion session." : (00:34:59.313)
Westman, Claire : "You'll be able to think about what you've been reading." : (00:35:02.508)
Westman, Claire : "You will have the questions that you're concerned about," : (00:35:06.068)
Westman, Claire : "all the areas that need clarification for you," : (00:35:09.386)
Westman, Claire : "so please do prepare in advance for those sessions." : (00:35:12.121)
Westman, Claire : "And then finally." : (00:35:16.718)
Westman, Claire : "Are there any expectations that you have for the module or that you have for" : (00:35:19.478)
Westman, Claire : "either me or for me and Mr. Popapi, as the PLS 1501 team?" : (00:35:25.250)
Westman, Claire : "Are there any things that in particular that you are hoping to gain from this or" : (00:35:29.838)
Westman, Claire : "that you hope you know we can help you with or that you expect from us while" : (00:35:34.701)
Westman, Claire : "you're going through the module or do you have any other questions or concerns as" : (00:35:39.324)
Westman, Claire : "you're getting?" : (00:35:44.248)
Westman, Claire : "Started with the module." : (00:35:45.148)
Westman, Claire : "If you do, you can put up your hand and ask them." : (00:35:46.308)
Westman, Claire : "You can pop them in the chat. Anything that you are at this stage" : (00:35:48.788)
Westman, Claire : "concerned about any questions you have at this stage." : (00:35:54.063)
Westman, Claire : "OK, while you're thinking and writing in the" : (00:36:01.778)
Westman, Claire : "chat." : (00:36:03.974)
Westman, Claire : "I will just say." : (00:36:05.718)
Westman, Claire : "With regards to the assessments, we often get emails from students saying" : (00:36:08.838)
Westman, Claire : "I haven't got my marks. My friend has got these or when are we" : (00:36:13.899)
Westman, Claire : "getting our marks?" : (00:36:18.207)
Westman, Claire : "So just so that you have an idea." : (00:36:19.558)
Westman, Claire : "The average turn around time or the time that we are given is between 2 weeks and" : (00:36:23.678)
Westman, Claire : "three weeks." : (00:36:29.226)
Westman, Claire : "So we aim very much to have your marks back to you within that time," : (00:36:30.828)
Westman, Claire : "two to three weeks, but sometimes remember, as I said," : (00:36:35.702)
Westman, Claire : "there's four of us who do marking." : (00:36:39.587)
Westman, Claire : "So one of your friends might have their marks done." : (00:36:42.188)
Westman, Claire : "Before it might get their assignment back before you," : (00:36:48.118)
Westman, Claire : "but if it goes past three weeks and you don't have your mark or everybody else" : (00:36:51.408)
Westman, Claire : "has theirs and you haven't seen yours, or there's an issue." : (00:36:56.222)
Westman, Claire : "Then please contact us, K." : (00:37:00.508)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:37:05.038)
Westman, Claire : "So I'm seeing a lot of questions here, so let me go through them." : (00:37:05.318)
Westman, Claire : "Help understanding Palmer needles." : (00:37:11.198)
Westman, Claire : "Please, we will focus on that in next week's" : (00:37:12.558)
Westman, Claire : "session if that is OK, Dylan." : (00:37:15.769)
Westman, Claire : "We'll have class once a week." : (00:37:19.678)
Westman, Claire : "It won't always be a teams meeting." : (00:37:21.758)
Westman, Claire : "Some weeks I will just load." : (00:37:24.478)
Westman, Claire : "Pre recorded lessons or reading material for you." : (00:37:28.358)
Westman, Claire : "So it won't always be an in person class, but in general it will be once a week and" : (00:37:33.308)
Westman, Claire : "it will be at this time every Wednesday." : (00:37:38.321)
Westman, Claire : "This seems to be a fairly good time since there are about 85 of you here," : (00:37:42.278)
Westman, Claire : "which is a very high turn out, so that's fantastic." : (00:37:46.554)
Westman, Claire : "How can you submit your assignment OK?" : (00:37:51.238)
Westman, Claire : "I'll very quickly once I've gone through the questions," : (00:37:54.238)
Westman, Claire : "share my screen to show you where you find the assignment and how you submit it." : (00:37:57.668)
Westman, Claire : "Tristan asks." : (00:38:05.508)
Westman, Claire : "Are there any specific YouTube channels or videos or other material for extra" : (00:38:06.388)
Westman, Claire : "info about philosophy and in general and just a fun listen or watch off the top of" : (00:38:11.269)
Westman, Claire : "my head right now?" : (00:38:16.462)
Westman, Claire : "I can't think of specific ones, but I will put a little list on." : (00:38:19.878)
Westman, Claire : "The site." : (00:38:27.078)
Westman, Claire : "I'm currently listening to. It's called a life well lived." : (00:38:29.358)
Westman, Claire : "It's a podcast." : (00:38:34.148)
Westman, Claire : "I found it on Spotify and it is hosted by Peter Singer who is a very renowned" : (00:38:35.508)
Westman, Claire : "philosopher." : (00:38:43.308)
Westman, Claire : "He's particularly works in animal ethics and utilitarianism," : (00:38:46.078)
Westman, Claire : "so not exactly what you're doing in this module," : (00:38:50.024)
Westman, Claire : "but it is a very interesting podcast he hosted with another with a Polish" : (00:38:53.194)
Westman, Claire : "philosopher." : (00:38:57.982)
Westman, Claire : "She does work around hedonism and they interviewing all kinds of people from" : (00:38:58.758)
Westman, Claire : "various sort of industries and walks of life." : (00:39:06.383)
Westman, Claire : "So the one I'm listening to at the moment is with a historian." : (00:39:10.938)
Westman, Claire : "Very interesting." : (00:39:14.898)
Westman, Claire : "That also have people on like Jane Goodall, the person who founded Peter," : (00:39:15.618)
Westman, Claire : "the Peter Organization." : (00:39:20.348)
Westman, Claire : "So that one's called a laugh." : (00:39:22.058)
Westman, Claire : "Well lived." : (00:39:24.098)
Westman, Claire : "It talks a lot about." : (00:39:24.818)
Westman, Claire : "What makes a good laugh?" : (00:39:27.918)
Westman, Claire : "Which are some of the things that you'll be sort of considering in this module?" : (00:39:29.518)
Westman, Claire : "What does it mean to live a good life?" : (00:39:33.188)
Westman, Claire : "How can we live with others?" : (00:39:34.788)
Westman, Claire : "How can we improve?" : (00:39:36.268)
Westman, Claire : "Sort of the world around us." : (00:39:37.868)
Westman, Claire : "So that's a great one." : (00:39:39.068)
Westman, Claire : "And it's not too complex." : (00:39:41.798)
Westman, Claire : "So that would be a good one to listen to, but otherwise I'll have a look for some" : (00:39:42.918)
Westman, Claire : "others for you as well." : (00:39:47.479)
Westman, Claire : "Turn it in." : (00:39:50.478)
Westman, Claire : "We will look closer at the time, but Turnitin is built into the my Unisa" : (00:39:51.198)
Westman, Claire : "platform." : (00:39:56.290)
Westman, Claire : "So when you submit your assignment on the in the normal assessment two submission" : (00:39:57.238)
Westman, Claire : "area, it will automatically be sent to turn it" : (00:40:02.978)
Westman, Claire : "in OK and you will get three opportunities." : (00:40:06.268)
Westman, Claire : "To submit it." : (00:40:10.918)
Westman, Claire : "So if you submit the first time and realize, Oh no, we oh," : (00:40:11.798)
Westman, Claire : "I didn't realize that I'd used AI to write this whole assignment." : (00:40:15.815)
Westman, Claire : "And now my whole thing's plagiarized, which would be a very odd thing," : (00:40:20.378)
Westman, Claire : "because you would know that you'd used AI." : (00:40:24.651)
Westman, Claire : "But if for some reason it happens that you get a very high turnitin result," : (00:40:27.178)
Westman, Claire : "you can resubmit." : (00:40:33.814)
Westman, Claire : "But I don't want to go too much into turnitin in now." : (00:40:36.868)
Westman, Claire : "But I know this is a question that I get all the time." : (00:40:39.988)
Westman, Claire : "What is an acceptable percentage on turnitin?" : (00:40:43.428)
Westman, Claire : "It's very difficult to say." : (00:40:47.708)
Westman, Claire : "Because we look at the more of the detail of the report rather than the percentage." : (00:40:51.178)
Westman, Claire : "So if you know you have paraphrased so you've written in your own words," : (00:40:57.418)
Westman, Claire : "you've included your referencing." : (00:41:01.688)
Westman, Claire : "You haven't used AI to do your answer, even if it's a higher percentage," : (00:41:03.818)
Westman, Claire : "you don't need to panic. OK, as long as you know you've done what you" : (00:41:08.479)
Westman, Claire : "need to." : (00:41:12.947)
Westman, Claire : "That's all you have to worry about." : (00:41:13.698)
Westman, Claire : "The unique codes they are there in the instructions," : (00:41:16.708)
Westman, Claire : "but you don't actually need them." : (00:41:19.223)
Westman, Claire : "That was, we say that you need to know the unique" : (00:41:20.788)
Westman, Claire : "code, but that was more for when you did paper" : (00:41:24.214)
Westman, Claire : "based submissions." : (00:41:27.435)
Westman, Claire : "Now obviously the submissions just come directly to us." : (00:41:28.868)
Westman, Claire : "So you don't need to worry too much, but they are on the instructions." : (00:41:31.948)
Westman, Claire : "I'll show you when we go there." : (00:41:35.668)
Westman, Claire : "I have not started a WhatsApp group for the module because there are concerns" : (00:41:38.628)
Westman, Claire : "around the protection of your information." : (00:41:43.620)
Westman, Claire : "You are very welcome to start a WhatsApp group for the module and you're welcome" : (00:41:46.948)
Westman, Claire : "to add me to that group." : (00:41:52.248)
Westman, Claire : "So I'll put my number here if you want to add me to the WhatsApp group," : (00:41:53.818)
Westman, Claire : "but there are some concerns around Poppy. If we start the group and add you so." : (00:42:00.260)
Westman, Claire : "Or you join." : (00:42:08.988)
Westman, Claire : "So I suggest that one of your students start the WhatsApp group and we can take" : (00:42:09.348)
Westman, Claire : "it from there." : (00:42:15.272)
Westman, Claire : "I will put a WhatsApp discussion forum and you can discuss there about joining" : (00:42:16.308)
Westman, Claire : "the WhatsApp group." : (00:42:23.466)
Westman, Claire : "OK. No, on the assignment we have to write each" : (00:42:29.098)
Westman, Claire : "question as essay." : (00:42:31.542)
Westman, Claire : "No, I've discussed that." : (00:42:32.458)
Westman, Claire : "You don't have to write each. You answer each question you say 1." : (00:42:33.898)
Westman, Claire : "So you've got question one, you answer it." : (00:42:39.988)
Westman, Claire : "You don't have to have an introduction and conclusion." : (00:42:41.908)
Westman, Claire : "It is not a proper essay." : (00:42:44.948)
Westman, Claire : "It is short answer questions so you don't include an introduction." : (00:42:46.508)
Westman, Claire : "Don't include a conclusion." : (00:42:50.988)
Westman, Claire : "You're just going to give us the most important information and develop an" : (00:42:52.428)
Westman, Claire : "argument, develop a discussion for each question." : (00:42:57.126)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:43:04.798)
Westman, Claire : "How the concept of philosophical thinking, epistemology, logic, metaphysics," : (00:43:05.958)
Westman, Claire : "having context with Western philosophy? OK," : (00:43:09.795)
Westman, Claire : "those are all things we're going to do in the module." : (00:43:11.987)
Westman, Claire : "So I'm not going to get into that now." : (00:43:14.758)
Westman, Claire : "It's a great question." : (00:43:16.638)
Westman, Claire : "Thank you, Elton." : (00:43:17.918)
Westman, Claire : "But that is sort of the core of the module." : (00:43:19.158)
Westman, Claire : "So we'll be working on those as we go through the module." : (00:43:22.195)
Westman, Claire : "Yes, favour asks. Is Google a reliable a Google Scholar?" : (00:43:27.828)
Westman, Claire : "Reliable source." : (00:43:32.028)
Westman, Claire : "Yes, Google Scholar is a very reliable source," : (00:43:33.618)
Westman, Claire : "so that is something that you can use for your research." : (00:43:36.510)
Westman, Claire : "The only problem with Google Scholar is that sometimes you will find an article" : (00:43:41.588)
Westman, Claire : "that sounds amazing." : (00:43:47.380)
Westman, Claire : "It's perfect." : (00:43:48.828)
Westman, Claire : "It's exactly what you need and all you can see is the abstract." : (00:43:49.588)
Westman, Claire : "So all you can see is a summary of the article and then it if you click on the" : (00:43:53.348)
Westman, Claire : "link it will take you to where they want you to pay to access the." : (00:43:58.142)
Westman, Claire : "It'll take you to to the journal site and the journal will want you to pay." : (00:44:02.207)
Westman, Claire : "For the article that's just that's very normal journal practice," : (00:44:06.818)
Westman, Claire : "but it means that it's been very difficult for you to sometimes access" : (00:44:11.424)
Westman, Claire : "those articles and that is why we have the online databases." : (00:44:16.455)
Westman, Claire : "So I will in the little video I'm going to do," : (00:44:20.898)
Westman, Claire : "I will show you how you can use Google Scholar, but you can also." : (00:44:23.993)
Westman, Claire : "When you use Google Scholar, if there's only an abstract," : (00:44:29.148)
Westman, Claire : "you can search for that source on the online databases or that article on the" : (00:44:32.450)
Westman, Claire : "online databases." : (00:44:36.890)
Westman, Claire : "If the full text is not available on Google Scholar very often," : (00:44:39.428)
Westman, Claire : "the full text is available on Google Scholar, but not always. OK," : (00:44:42.816)
Westman, Claire : "but it's of good source, and that's a very good question." : (00:44:46.309)
Westman, Claire : "Thank you." : (00:44:49.379)
Westman, Claire : "Another place that you can sometimes find good articles is on a place called" : (00:44:51.708)
Westman, Claire : "ResearchGate." : (00:44:56.841)
Westman, Claire : "So sometimes I've put the thing in the name in the comments." : (00:45:00.428)
Westman, Claire : "Sometimes people will load to the articles onto." : (00:45:05.713)
Westman, Claire : "ResearchGate their own articles that they've written." : (00:45:11.508)
Westman, Claire : "And sometimes." : (00:45:15.428)
Westman, Claire : "They you can e-mail them even and ask them to send you the article." : (00:45:18.668)
Westman, Claire : "So that's another place that you can look." : (00:45:24.988)
Westman, Claire : "OK, I understand referencing is very tricky" : (00:45:28.588)
Westman, Claire : "and I will post so please look at the tutorial letter 301 for help with that as" : (00:45:32.255)
Westman, Claire : "well." : (00:45:38.921)
Westman, Claire : "I will also post." : (00:45:39.818)
Westman, Claire : "I'll do it this afternoon." : (00:45:41.258)
Westman, Claire : "A whole lot of extra." : (00:45:43.178)
Westman, Claire : "Lessons on the discussion forum for how to do referencing," : (00:45:47.028)
Westman, Claire : "but we can talk about it a little bit next week because we're running out of" : (00:45:50.568)
Westman, Claire : "time very quickly now." : (00:45:55.188)
Westman, Claire : "For how to do referencing OK and at this stage of the year, your first years," : (00:45:58.108)
Westman, Claire : "you're new to the university." : (00:46:03.648)
Westman, Claire : "We know that you might not reference perfectly what we wanna see at this stage" : (00:46:06.178)
Westman, Claire : "is that you are attempting to reference K." : (00:46:12.446)
Westman, Claire : "Do you reference at the end OK." : (00:46:17.548)
Westman, Claire : "I've just got a notification that I've been added to the group." : (00:46:19.508)
Westman, Claire : "Thank you for whoever started it." : (00:46:22.108)
Westman, Claire : "Do you write references after each question or reference at the end of" : (00:46:24.668)
Westman, Claire : "everything? So in text referencing you do in your" : (00:46:30.171)
Westman, Claire : "answer." : (00:46:34.046)
Westman, Claire : "So where you use the information you include the reference." : (00:46:35.378)
Westman, Claire : "So if I write a sentence saying Plato says that all we see on Earth are" : (00:46:39.738)
Westman, Claire : "imitations of the form, I would put my reference there." : (00:46:45.723)
Westman, Claire : "Then I'd carry on my next sentence explaining. OK," : (00:46:50.378)
Westman, Claire : "so you do this two kinds of referencing is in text referencing." : (00:46:54.618)
Westman, Claire : "Which is in your answer. And then there's a bibliography that goes" : (00:47:00.748)
Westman, Claire : "at the very end, which includes you're referencing for" : (00:47:04.597)
Westman, Claire : "everything, OK." : (00:47:07.756)
Westman, Claire : "So yeah, again, I'll post some more resources for that." : (00:47:08.898)
Westman, Claire : "When you submit your assessment, there should be a little." : (00:47:15.468)
Westman, Claire : "Thing that you click that says that your honesty declaration." : (00:47:20.628)
Westman, Claire : "So that should be there when you click that." : (00:47:26.788)
Westman, Claire : "OK, I will show you." : (00:47:30.628)
M SELOMO : "Marble record." : (00:47:32.558)
Westman, Claire : "Someone ask you a question or they just unmute by accident." : (00:47:35.608)
Westman, Claire : "OK, OK. Carlos answered some of your questions." : (00:47:40.408)
Westman, Claire : "So in the chat." : (00:47:44.401)
Westman, Claire : "So that's great." : (00:47:45.648)
Westman, Claire : "Let me just see, these are all WhatsApp things." : (00:47:47.008)
Westman, Claire : "You see, if there's anything else." : (00:47:50.488)
Westman, Claire : "Yes, Tristan also mentioned here, as I mentioned," : (00:47:57.928)
Westman, Claire : "sometimes if you e-mail the person who wrote the article," : (00:48:00.815)
Westman, Claire : "they will send it to you for free." : (00:48:04.165)
Westman, Claire : "And that's why so research creates also a great place for that." : (00:48:07.828)
Westman, Claire : "Because you can just send them a message and they can sometimes send you the" : (00:48:11.188)
Westman, Claire : "article." : (00:48:14.920)
Westman, Claire : "I mean, some people are very busy, so they don't." : (00:48:15.308)
Westman, Claire : "But some will OK." : (00:48:17.588)
Westman, Claire : "I'm going to stop sharing the screen." : (00:48:19.468)
Westman, Claire : "Uh, what am I doing?" : (00:48:29.628)
M SELOMO : "Repl." : (00:48:31.068)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:48:33.508)
Westman, Claire : "Let me just do this." : (00:48:34.028)
Westman, Claire : "Let me open, OK." : (00:48:35.708)
Westman, Claire : "Here's our site." : (00:48:37.828)
Westman, Claire : "Let me just share my screen with you." : (00:48:38.548)
M SELOMO : "Play." : (00:48:43.908)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:48:44.468)
Westman, Claire : "So here we are on the can you all see the PLS 1501 site?" : (00:48:44.748)
Westman, Claire : "OK, cool." : (00:48:53.178)
Westman, Claire : "So somebody asked about the 301 litre. So to access that you will go here to" : (00:48:55.348)
Westman, Claire : "official study material." : (00:49:01.783)
Westman, Claire : "So obviously you're seeing my view, which is slightly different from yours." : (00:49:06.298)
Westman, Claire : "Actually, let me just change this to student view" : (00:49:10.218)
Westman, Claire : "and then." : (00:49:12.455)
Westman, Claire : "It's not leading me, OK." : (00:49:20.178)
Westman, Claire : "So you go to official study material and here is tutorial letter 301, OK." : (00:49:25.428)
Westman, Claire : "So then you'll just click on that and it's apdf document." : (00:49:31.108)
Westman, Claire : "It will open for you." : (00:49:34.468)
Westman, Claire : "OK. And then for the assignment?" : (00:49:37.268)
Westman, Claire : "Somebody asked about assessment one again." : (00:49:39.388)
Westman, Claire : "You go here on the left hand side to assessment one." : (00:49:42.228)
Westman, Claire : "There are brief instructions here, but you need to open the PDF here." : (00:49:48.628)
Westman, Claire : "I'm not going to re download it, but you open it there and it will" : (00:49:54.708)
Westman, Claire : "download and all your instructions will be in there." : (00:49:58.192)
Westman, Claire : "Let me see if here I have it open." : (00:50:02.508)
Westman, Claire : "But can you see the assessment there?" : (00:50:06.028)
Westman, Claire : "Yes. So here is what the assessment looks like." : (00:50:08.188)
Westman, Claire : "Here are the instructions." : (00:50:13.508)
Westman, Claire : "Here's where it says don't need to include introduction or conclusion." : (00:50:14.788)
Westman, Claire : "Very important notes about using AI." : (00:50:19.898)

Klaas Mampa : "Could more than a sentence in that case, what will happen?" : (01:00:13.278)
Westman, Claire : "I mean, we'll still read it, but if you're quoting a whole paragraph" : (01:00:19.128)
Westman, Claire : "in a in an answer of 300 words, that's a whole chunk of the work where we" : (01:00:24.271)
Westman, Claire : "can't see if you actually understand it." : (01:00:29.787)
Westman, Claire : "Or if you're just sticking a paragraph quote in, because to fill up a space." : (01:00:34.198)
Westman, Claire : "So when you get to higher levels of study, you can include entire paragraphs" : (01:00:40.118)
Westman, Claire : "sometimes or longer quotes because you're submitting much longer documents." : (01:00:45.589)

Westman, Claire : "If you're including very long paragraphs or very long quotes," : (01:01:00.488)

Westman, Claire : "That is why it is preferable." : (01:01:28.928)
Westman, Claire : "It's best for you to only include short quotes or one or two sentences here or" : (01:01:31.208)
Westman, Claire : "there, or short phrases instead of whole" : (01:01:37.967)
Westman, Claire : "paragraphs. OK." : (01:01:41.475)
Westman, Claire : "Obviously, if you're in putting whole quotes whole" : (01:01:44.568)
Westman, Claire : "paragraphs in it will lead to you not getting as many marks," : (01:01:48.839)
Westman, Claire : "because it's not necessarily your own work, OK." : (01:01:53.948)
Westman, Claire : "So quoting is fine, but you do have to consider limiting the" : (01:01:57.968)
Westman, Claire : "quotas and focusing more on paraphrasing and explaining, rather than just quoting." : (01:02:02.861)
Westman, Claire : "OK. OK. And then we've got a question from Luanda." : (01:02:15.598)

Westman, Claire : "You don't have to write the word count at the end. You can include it." : (01:06:34.338)
Westman, Claire : "But obviously we can sort of tell straight away how many words it is." : (01:06:41.408)
Westman, Claire : "But it can be helpful if you include a word count." : (01:06:44.848)
Westman, Claire : "And yes, if you're answering 300 words, you can write in paragraphs." : (01:06:49.318)
Westman, Claire : "Remember 1 idea per paragraph, so you can write in paragraphs when you" : (01:06:57.808)

Westman, Claire : "Philosophy in general, and like I said in the last meeting," : (00:01:21.110)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy is it's different." : (00:01:26.315)
Westman, Claire : "It's a different kind of text." : (00:01:28.830)
Westman, Claire : "It's a different way of reading and thinking than you're probably used to," : (00:01:31.030)
Westman, Claire : "so please don't panic too much." : (00:01:35.559)
Westman, Claire : "You will hopefully sort of get used to it as you're going through as you're reading" : (00:01:38.960)
Westman, Claire : "more." : (00:01:43.717)
Westman, Claire : "And also just use different resources because sometimes some people learn" : (00:01:46.480)
Westman, Claire : "better using different kinds of resources." : (00:01:50.385)
Westman, Claire : "If, for example, you are struggling with understanding" : (00:01:53.280)
Westman, Claire : "what's in the study guide, there are so many very good videos on" : (00:01:58.014)
Westman, Claire : "YouTube that breakdown these complex concepts into quite simple explanations." : (00:02:03.608)
Westman, Claire : "And obviously you know, those are resources that are available to" : (00:02:10.560)
Westman, Claire : "you." : (00:02:14.973)
Westman, Claire : "So go and do your own research." : (00:02:15.240)
Westman, Claire : "Go look and see what you can find." : (00:02:17.840)
Westman, Claire : "That will help you look for different kinds of texts." : (00:02:19.920)
Westman, Claire : "Look for different kinds of blogs." : (00:02:23.150)
Westman, Claire : "Anything that's going to help you understand better." : (00:02:26.670)
Westman, Claire : "Just remember that when it comes to including evidence in your assignments," : (00:02:30.939)
Westman, Claire : "it must be credible." : (00:02:37.060)
Westman, Claire : "Academic evidence." : (00:02:38.830)
Westman, Claire : "So while I suggest you go and watch videos and you can read blogs you can" : (00:02:41.920)
Westman, Claire : "read." : (00:02:47.691)
Westman, Claire : "Whatever you can find that helps you understand when you are using the" : (00:02:49.990)
Westman, Claire : "information in your assignment, you must make sure that it is from" : (00:02:55.076)
Westman, Claire : "credible academic sources. So use those online databases." : (00:02:59.876)
Westman, Claire : "I put the video." : (00:03:04.030)
Westman, Claire : "Online for you if you haven't watched it yet." : (00:03:05.670)
Westman, Claire : "Please some people. OK, let me just mute all in case." : (00:03:10.000)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:03:14.640)
Westman, Claire : "Please make sure that you go and watch that video if you don't know how to use" : (00:03:16.600)
Westman, Claire : "the online databases yet." : (00:03:20.733)
Westman, Claire : "Hopefully those of you who have watched it already found it helpful." : (00:03:22.040)
Westman, Claire : "I know it was about half an hour, but I wanted to make sure that you fully" : (00:03:26.480)
Westman, Claire : "understood how to use it and could play around on it, not just for this module." : (00:03:30.777)
Westman, Claire : "But for all your modules, so please use resources available to you" : (00:03:35.670)
Westman, Claire : "and don't just panic because you don't understand what's in the study guide." : (00:03:39.597)
Westman, Claire : "There are lots of resources that you can use that try that will hopefully help you" : (00:03:44.110)
Westman, Claire : "to understand a bit better. So in today's session I'm just going to" : (00:03:50.097)
Westman, Claire : "be going over some of the content that might help you to answer questions one" : (00:03:55.002)
Westman, Claire : "and question 2 for assessment one." : (00:04:00.628)
Westman, Claire : "Next week." : (00:04:03.880)
Westman, Claire : "I know it's the day before your assignment is due," : (00:04:05.190)
Westman, Claire : "but we're going to look at question 3." : (00:04:08.216)
Westman, Claire : "So what I suggest is that by the time we get to next Wednesday," : (00:04:10.590)
Westman, Claire : "you have question one and two complete and finished and happy you're happy with" : (00:04:15.296)
Westman, Claire : "it to submit and that you've started working on Question 3." : (00:04:21.179)
Westman, Claire : "So make sure you've done the reading for Question 3." : (00:04:25.630)
Westman, Claire : "Make sure you've started coming up with your answers so that when we do the" : (00:04:28.750)
Westman, Claire : "session." : (00:04:33.093)
Westman, Claire : "You can just go back and check if there's any." : (00:04:34.160)
Westman, Claire : "Thing you need to add or anything you need to change." : (00:04:36.870)
Westman, Claire : "And you think extra that's come up while we were doing the session so that you" : (00:04:40.750)
Westman, Claire : "don't have to then rush to try and finish it by the next day." : (00:04:46.062)
Westman, Claire : "So that's my suggestion for you." : (00:04:50.590)
Westman, Claire : "We're not going to approach this semester quite this way," : (00:04:54.760)
Westman, Claire : "but I've seen on the the WhatsApp group and from the emails and on the platform" : (00:04:58.802)
Westman, Claire : "that there is quite a lot of stress and I don't want you to stress so much so." : (00:05:04.376)
Westman, Claire : "We're going to do that today." : (00:05:11.070)
Westman, Claire : "So we're going to look at question one and then we're going to look at Question" : (00:05:12.230)
Westman, Claire : "2." : (00:05:16.445)
Westman, Claire : "Then you can ask questions." : (00:05:17.550)
Westman, Claire : "I do want to keep this within an hour because I know you have a lot going on" : (00:05:19.550)
Westman, Claire : "and you need to work on the assignment and everybody's busy and you've got other" : (00:05:24.486)
Westman, Claire : "classes." : (00:05:29.678)
Westman, Claire : "So we're going to try and keep it so that we end by 11. Obviously," : (00:05:30.190)
Westman, Claire : "if there are any other questions that you have, you're welcome to e-mail them to me." : (00:05:34.316)
Westman, Claire : "Put them on the PLS 1501 site." : (00:05:40.390)
Westman, Claire : "It's great to see that a lot of you are what's also great to see is on the" : (00:05:44.310)
Westman, Claire : "WhatsApp group that you're all helping each other and giving each other advice" : (00:05:48.993)
Westman, Claire : "and suggestions. That is fantastic." : (00:05:53.925)
Westman, Claire : "I'm so glad to see that." : (00:05:56.110)
Westman, Claire : "So thank you to everybody for engaging with each other for helping each other" : (00:05:57.710)
Westman, Claire : "and for trying to help everyone else be successful as well in the module." : (00:06:02.431)
Westman, Claire : "So because we're focusing." : (00:06:07.680)
Westman, Claire : "On the questions that you have for the assessment, I'm not going to go into." : (00:06:10.270)
Westman, Claire : "Detail about units one and two." : (00:06:17.320)
Westman, Claire : "We're going to look at what would most likely be the most useful information to" : (00:06:20.560)
Westman, Claire : "help you answer the assessments questions." : (00:06:26.567)
Westman, Claire : "I'm also not going to go over everything that's in your study guide." : (00:06:29.960)
Westman, Claire : "The study guide is there for you to read and hopefully after the lesson," : (00:06:35.360)
Westman, Claire : "if you go back and read." : (00:06:40.026)
Westman, Claire : "You might feel a little bit more comfortable with it as well." : (00:06:42.030)
Westman, Claire : "So I'm definitely not going over the study guards information." : (00:06:45.960)
Westman, Claire : "We're going to look at very summarized version of those two sections of the" : (00:06:49.240)
Westman, Claire : "study guide that will be important for right now." : (00:06:54.162)
Westman, Claire : "So." : (00:06:59.160)
Westman, Claire : "You might still have questions about units one and two," : (00:07:01.760)
Westman, Claire : "but we will also come back to those after the assessment is submitted and you're" : (00:07:04.991)
Westman, Claire : "feeling a bit less panicked." : (00:07:09.665)
Westman, Claire : "OK so." : (00:07:12.170)
Westman, Claire : "The first question is." : (00:07:15.160)
Westman, Claire : "Related to African philosophy." : (00:07:19.000)
Westman, Claire : "So the question asks you is the continued dominance of Western philosophy in an" : (00:07:21.320)
Westman, Claire : "African country something ethically desirable and sustainable? In your answer," : (00:07:27.770)
Westman, Claire : "you must consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of prioritising Western" : (00:07:34.138)
Westman, Claire : "philosophical thought." : (00:07:40.507)
Westman, Claire : "In this context, so the first thing I want to do is" : (00:07:42.750)
Westman, Claire : "breakdown this question so you will see I've highlighted some words here and the" : (00:07:46.380)
Westman, Claire : "oops, sorry." : (00:07:52.033)
Westman, Claire : "Dominance of Western philosophy." : (00:07:54.480)
Westman, Claire : "Let's see dominance of Western philosophy." : (00:07:58.280)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:08:00.960)
Westman, Claire : "Maybe that's making it worse." : (00:08:01.200)
Westman, Claire : "Harder to see." : (00:08:04.640)
Westman, Claire : "Oh, so that is content that you have to focus" : (00:08:05.440)
Westman, Claire : "on." : (00:08:10.885)
Westman, Claire : "In an African country, you can look specifically at South Africa" : (00:08:12.230)
Westman, Claire : "because that is focused on in your study guide," : (00:08:16.492)
Westman, Claire : "you can speak about African countries more generally," : (00:08:19.638)
Westman, Claire : "but I think it would be beneficial for you to focus on South Africa because that" : (00:08:23.178)
Westman, Claire : "is what is discussed in detail." : (00:08:28.488)
Westman, Claire : "In the study guide, So what we're looking at is how Western" : (00:08:30.520)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy is still dominant." : (00:08:34.559)
Westman, Claire : "In African." : (00:08:37.280)
Westman, Claire : "Universities, African institutions." : (00:08:40.400)
Westman, Claire : "Higher learning institutions so." : (00:08:42.110)
Westman, Claire : "What are the potential benefits of Western philosophy?" : (00:08:46.830)
Westman, Claire : "What are the potential drawbacks of making Western philosophy more prominent" : (00:08:49.630)
Westman, Claire : "in an African country than it is than is African philosophy OK?" : (00:08:55.725)
Westman, Claire : "So that's the content. The dominance of Western philosophy." : (00:09:00.790)
Westman, Claire : "Your focus is on an African country and some of the things you're going to look" : (00:09:04.790)
Westman, Claire : "at are the benefits of prioritizing Western philosophical thought." : (00:09:10.124)
Westman, Claire : "And the negatives or the drawbacks?" : (00:09:15.320)
Westman, Claire : "Of prioritizing Western philosophy at philosophical thought," : (00:09:17.630)
Westman, Claire : "but what you also need to argue is an ethically desirable." : (00:09:22.510)
Westman, Claire : "Is it something that can be argued for ethically?" : (00:09:29.120)
Westman, Claire : "Should this should Western philosophy continue to be prioritized over African" : (00:09:34.160)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy?" : (00:09:40.260)
Westman, Claire : "What are the ethical implications of that?" : (00:09:41.840)
Westman, Claire : "And then is it sustainable?" : (00:09:45.860)
Westman, Claire : "Can it continue?" : (00:09:47.900)
Westman, Claire : "Can we continue to prioritize Western philosophy in an African context?" : (00:09:49.380)
Westman, Claire : "What are the problems that might make it unsustainable?" : (00:09:56.960)
Westman, Claire : "What are the reasons that it might be sustainable?" : (00:10:00.640)
Westman, Claire : "So what this question is asking you is to think about why Western philosophy is" : (00:10:04.030)
Westman, Claire : "dominant." : (00:10:11.150)
Westman, Claire : "Why it is a problem?" : (00:10:13.190)
Westman, Claire : "Or maybe not a problem that it is prioritized and should it continue to be" : (00:10:15.070)
Westman, Claire : "prioritized or not?" : (00:10:21.836)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:10:25.320)
Westman, Claire : "So whenever you have a question, try to break it down and think what what" : (00:10:25.480)
Westman, Claire : "is the content of the question." : (00:10:30.555)
Westman, Claire : "So what is the focus of the question and what is it asking me to do?" : (00:10:32.960)
Westman, Claire : "How am I supposed to answer this?" : (00:10:37.720)
Westman, Claire : "So you will see that this is not just asking you." : (00:10:39.840)
Westman, Claire : "To explain why Western philosophy is prioritized," : (00:10:44.230)
Westman, Claire : "it's asking you to go beyond that." : (00:10:49.088)
Westman, Claire : "It's asking you to develop an argument." : (00:10:52.390)
Westman, Claire : "For where you explain why you think it is desirable or not," : (00:10:57.320)
Westman, Claire : "and why you think it is sustainable or not," : (00:11:01.298)
Westman, Claire : "so you're going to go beyond just explaining what's in the study guide in" : (00:11:04.214)
Westman, Claire : "order to develop this argument that shows us what your opinion is." : (00:11:09.119)
Westman, Claire : "But remember, these are not opinion pieces," : (00:11:14.470)
Westman, Claire : "so they need to be backed up with your evidence." : (00:11:17.233)
Westman, Claire : "Again, the study guide is the main source, but you can use other any other academic" : (00:11:20.990)
Westman, Claire : "resources that help you to answer the question." : (00:11:27.150)
Westman, Claire : "So let's break it down." : (00:11:32.110)
Westman, Claire : "The introduction of Western philosophy to South Africa." : (00:11:35.120)
Westman, Claire : "Came with sort of the colonization of Africa." : (00:11:39.800)
Westman, Claire : "And with the arrival of colonizers in South Africa, so again," : (00:11:44.680)
Westman, Claire : "I'm not going to go into this in detail." : (00:11:48.814)
Westman, Claire : "It's in your study guide." : (00:11:51.480)
Westman, Claire : "And this is not necessarily something you need to explain in detail," : (00:11:55.870)
Westman, Claire : "but it might help you to provide a little bit of background into the question or" : (00:12:00.957)
Westman, Claire : "into your answer to say why it is not ethically sustainable," : (00:12:06.929)
Westman, Claire : "why it is or ethically desirable, why it is a problem." : (00:12:11.426)
Westman, Claire : "That Western philosophy is still prioritized." : (00:12:16.310)
Westman, Claire : "So when Western philosophy was brought to South African universities and" : (00:12:19.390)
Westman, Claire : "institutions." : (00:12:24.076)
Westman, Claire : "There was 2 main traditions that were brought into our universities," : (00:12:27.230)
Westman, Claire : "so the first was the Afrikaans Continental tradition." : (00:12:32.952)
Westman, Claire : "And in the study guide it explains that this was found in particular universities." : (00:12:38.920)
Westman, Claire : "The kinds of people that some of the most influential figures in the tradition," : (00:12:43.720)
Westman, Claire : "what sort of the philosophy focused on, but the main point." : (00:12:49.526)
Westman, Claire : "Is that philosophical theories that came out of this tradition were often used to" : (00:12:54.430)
Westman, Claire : "support and justify apartheid and discrimination," : (00:13:01.901)
Westman, Claire : "so they were bringing philosophical theories from Europe to South Africa and" : (00:13:06.456)
Westman, Claire : "then using those as justification for apartheid and for discrimination." : (00:13:13.471)
Westman, Claire : "Against the indigenous people of South Africa." : (00:13:20.800)
Westman, Claire : "The other main tradition was the Anglo-Saxon tradition." : (00:13:24.280)
Westman, Claire : "Again, go read through your study guide to see" : (00:13:28.280)
Westman, Claire : "which universities it was founded, who the sort of most prominent figures in" : (00:13:31.350)
Westman, Claire : "their tradition were, and sort of what the focus of that" : (00:13:36.378)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy was." : (00:13:40.101)
Westman, Claire : "But again, it was also used to justify racial and" : (00:13:41.560)
Westman, Claire : "cultural discrimination when it sort of first came to the country." : (00:13:44.552)
Westman, Claire : "However." : (00:13:49.240)
Westman, Claire : "In this tradition or in these universities?" : (00:13:51.000)
Westman, Claire : "There was a movement towards social and political resistance against apartheid," : (00:13:53.910)
Westman, Claire : "against discrimination." : (00:13:59.223)
Westman, Claire : "And so that can be seen sort of arising in what were traditionally sort of more" : (00:14:02.200)
Westman, Claire : "English speaking universities. However, you will see in the study guide that" : (00:14:08.650)
Westman, Claire : "there's also a lot of contestation." : (00:14:14.859)
Westman, Claire : "There's a lot of critique of this idea because it was argued that." : (00:14:17.680)
Westman, Claire : "A lot of political resistance came out of these universities that there were people" : (00:14:23.270)
Westman, Claire : "sort of standing up against discrimination and against apartheid" : (00:14:29.952)
Westman, Claire : "ideologies, but very often." : (00:14:35.123)
Westman, Claire : "In reality, that wasn't really the situation." : (00:14:38.720)
Westman, Claire : "It was still this ongoing discrimination, this ongoing hierarchy in the" : (00:14:41.440)
Westman, Claire : "universities that privileged white people that privileged Western ideologies over" : (00:14:46.401)
Westman, Claire : "African ideologies." : (00:14:52.051)
Westman, Claire : "They're privileged." : (00:14:54.520)
Westman, Claire : "The colonizers, rather than making a real move towards" : (00:14:56.760)
Westman, Claire : "decolonization, towards." : (00:15:02.414)
Westman, Claire : "Sort of going against discrimination and going against." : (00:15:06.440)
Westman, Claire : "The subordination of indigenous or black people in South Africa." : (00:15:11.840)
Westman, Claire : "So these are just the sort of main traditions that came into South Africa." : (00:15:18.000)
Westman, Claire : "When philosophy was first introduced into universities." : (00:15:25.310)
Westman, Claire : "Go read through that section." : (00:15:30.520)
Westman, Claire : "It's not imperative." : (00:15:32.160)
Westman, Claire : "It's not vital for your assignment, but it can help you to sort of have the" : (00:15:34.080)
Westman, Claire : "background or the the groundwork for why Western philosophy became so dominant in" : (00:15:40.502)
Westman, Claire : "South African philosoph philosophy departments in the 1st place," : (00:15:47.431)
Westman, Claire : "but also for why." : (00:15:52.924)
Westman, Claire : "It might still be problematic K, because if." : (00:15:54.950)
Westman, Claire : "These traditions are still sort of the foundation of philosophy departments" : (00:16:00.080)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy curricula today." : (00:16:06.160)
Westman, Claire : "Are they still contributing towards?" : (00:16:09.880)
Westman, Claire : "The undermining of African knowledge systems," : (00:16:14.280)
Westman, Claire : "are they still contributing to privileging Western knowledge over?" : (00:16:17.505)
Westman, Claire : "African knowledge." : (00:16:23.640)
Westman, Claire : "Are they still perpetuating the ideas?" : (00:16:24.950)
Westman, Claire : "That came when they were first introduced in South Africa in Africa." : (00:16:30.720)
Westman, Claire : "Sorry, I've got a bit of a cough today." : (00:16:36.520)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:16:40.470)
Westman, Claire : "So that's sort of just to help you have that foundation for understanding." : (00:16:40.670)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:16:47.120)
Westman, Claire : "Obviously, over time there has been a lot of change" : (00:16:49.200)
Westman, Claire : "in philosophy curricula." : (00:16:52.019)
Westman, Claire : "There's been a lot of change in philosophy departments." : (00:16:53.320)
Westman, Claire : "There's been a move towards trying to bring in more African philosophy to" : (00:16:56.120)
Westman, Claire : "trying to do away with a lot of the sort of hierarchies and the discrimination." : (00:17:02.579)
Westman, Claire : "That was present, but it's for you to think about." : (00:17:09.670)
Westman, Claire : "Has this happened?" : (00:17:13.396)
Westman, Claire : "Our philosophy departments you might." : (00:17:16.880)
Westman, Claire : "You obviously might not have a lot of." : (00:17:18.680)
Westman, Claire : "Experience with philosophy departments, but thinking about it," : (00:17:22.800)
Westman, Claire : "do you think that we have made a move?" : (00:17:27.391)
Westman, Claire : "So what this has led to is that in contemporary philosophy departments," : (00:17:30.760)
Westman, Claire : "contemporary philosophy curriculums just contemporary philosophy in general." : (00:17:35.071)
Westman, Claire : "African experiences have been disregarded in favor of Western experiences." : (00:17:41.630)
Westman, Claire : "Western Knowledge Systems, Western beliefs." : (00:17:47.870)
Westman, Claire : "This means that African philosophy remains largely marginalized or devalued." : (00:17:51.800)
Westman, Claire : "And it's often seen as an inferior alternative to Western philosophy." : (00:17:59.080)
Westman, Claire : "So even where African philosophy is offered at universities, often it is." : (00:18:03.000)
Westman, Claire : "Is considered to be sort of and you'll see it says this in the study guide," : (00:18:09.910)
Westman, Claire : "like in quotes and quotes." : (00:18:14.470)
Westman, Claire : "An exotic option rather than the main philosophy that you study." : (00:18:16.030)
Westman, Claire : "It's like it's sort of an alternative to Western philosophy," : (00:18:21.670)
Westman, Claire : "which is considered the main or predominant philosophy." : (00:18:26.200)
Westman, Claire : "So African philosophy remains undervalued. It remains marginal." : (00:18:30.358)
Westman, Claire : "It remains considered inferior to Western philosophy." : (00:18:35.880)
Westman, Claire : "And obviously this is tied to racist ideas around the humanity and rationality" : (00:18:40.110)
Westman, Claire : "of Africans." : (00:18:46.326)
Westman, Claire : "So if you are doing introduction to African philosophy as well." : (00:18:47.510)
Westman, Claire : "You will there learn quite a lot about how a lot of the reason that African" : (00:18:53.160)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy is still marginalized and devalued is because of this ongoing" : (00:18:59.496)
Westman, Claire : "colonial racist idea that African people." : (00:19:05.582)
Westman, Claire : "Cannot use rationality." : (00:19:09.510)
Westman, Claire : "African people cannot reason as well as Western people as well as white people," : (00:19:11.110)
Westman, Claire : "so this is an awful ongoing racist idea that continues to play into the reason" : (00:19:17.562)
Westman, Claire : "that African philosophy is." : (00:19:23.933)
Westman, Claire : "Considered marginal?" : (00:19:27.270)
Westman, Claire : "Always considered as inferior to Western philosophy." : (00:19:28.230)
Westman, Claire : "Obviously there's been a lot of change around those ideas has been a lot of" : (00:19:32.390)
Westman, Claire : "progress." : (00:19:36.825)
Westman, Claire : "Towards moving away from those ideas, but some of the reason why African" : (00:19:38.840)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy is still not considered as important as Western philosophy ties into." : (00:19:43.808)
Westman, Claire : "The the ideologies associated with African reason and rationality." : (00:19:51.880)
Westman, Claire : "Team. So in order for philosophy to be" : (00:19:56.870)
Westman, Claire : "liberated and to be considered." : (00:20:01.082)
Westman, Claire : "You know as important or even or as valuable or." : (00:20:05.960)
Westman, Claire : "To sort of have as important a place in philosophy as does Western philosophy." : (00:20:12.190)
Westman, Claire : "That is argued that African philosophy should become the lens or the framework" : (00:20:18.820)
Westman, Claire : "through which other philosophical traditions are viewed and engaged with." : (00:20:23.812)
Westman, Claire : "As it currently stands." : (00:20:28.487)
Westman, Claire : "Western philosophy is considered the framework or the the lens through which" : (00:20:31.470)
Westman, Claire : "we view African philosophy." : (00:20:36.860)
Westman, Claire : "So we use Western philosophical frameworks or ideas to understand Africa" : (00:20:38.750)
Westman, Claire : "and African philosophy." : (00:20:45.077)
Westman, Claire : "And I see a very good question in the chat, which we're going to get to." : (00:20:47.580)
Westman, Claire : "Which we're going to think about now as we move through these." : (00:20:54.950)
Westman, Claire : "So it's a very good question." : (00:20:59.070)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:21:02.550)
Westman, Claire : "So when you are answering the question, let's just go back and look at the" : (00:21:06.670)
Westman, Claire : "question again when you're answering the question," : (00:21:11.511)
Westman, Claire : "you're asked to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks or negatives of" : (00:21:14.803)
Westman, Claire : "prioritizing Western philosophical thought in this context." : (00:21:19.838)
Westman, Claire : "So what it's asking you to do is to think about why it might be justifiable." : (00:21:24.070)
Westman, Claire : "And a good thing." : (00:21:32.390)
Westman, Claire : "To continue to prioritize Western thought." : (00:21:34.340)
Westman, Claire : "And White might not be." : (00:21:38.910)
Westman, Claire : "So let's look at some of the value of Western philosophy." : (00:21:39.990)
Westman, Claire : "So Western philosophy." : (00:21:46.190)
Westman, Claire : "Can provide us with studying Western philosophy like you are in this module." : (00:21:49.470)
Westman, Claire : "Can give insights into and knowledge of theories that are very prominent in" : (00:21:53.510)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy globally." : (00:21:58.102)
Westman, Claire : "They can then be applied to African." : (00:22:00.990)
Westman, Claire : "Challenges, context, realities." : (00:22:03.420)
Westman, Claire : "Obviously, Western philosophy is there's a lot more" : (00:22:06.260)
Westman, Claire : "access to the writings of Western philosophy," : (00:22:09.973)
Westman, Claire : "and that is one of the reasons it's also become sort of more dominant is because" : (00:22:13.257)
Westman, Claire : "we have more access to the recordings of Western philosophers," : (00:22:19.041)
Westman, Claire : "the writings of Western philosophers." : (00:22:23.539)
Westman, Claire : "So we can argue that." : (00:22:26.500)
Westman, Claire : "Western philosophy gives us theories. It gives us information." : (00:22:30.030)
Westman, Claire : "And it gives us frameworks that we can use and that we can apply to African" : (00:22:34.500)
Westman, Claire : "challenges." : (00:22:40.371)
Westman, Claire : "Context live realities." : (00:22:41.220)
Westman, Claire : "We can adapt them in order to make them relevant to our situations, our contexts." : (00:22:43.140)
Westman, Claire : "So that's one thing you might argue in in favour of Western philosophy." : (00:22:51.220)
Westman, Claire : "Another thing is that the conceptual tools and frameworks, as I said," : (00:22:57.670)
Westman, Claire : "are recognized." : (00:23:02.579)
Westman, Claire : "Understood and applied globally. So if you want to or currently as it is," : (00:23:04.300)
Westman, Claire : "if you want to engage in philosophy on a global level, often you need." : (00:23:09.628)
Westman, Claire : "Well, generally you need to have an" : (00:23:14.740)
Westman, Claire : "understanding." : (00:23:16.843)
Westman, Claire : "Of those dominant theories and frameworks, in order to be able to contribute to the" : (00:23:19.070)
Westman, Claire : "global philosophical discourse." : (00:23:25.089)
Westman, Claire : "And then obviously these are also applied to many other fields like law." : (00:23:29.110)
Westman, Claire : "So to engage in philosophy on a global level," : (00:23:33.420)
Westman, Claire : "you have to have that foundational knowledge that comes from Western" : (00:23:36.399)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy." : (00:23:40.868)
Westman, Claire : "But we are then able to adapt that to the African context." : (00:23:42.380)
Westman, Claire : "So that is why you might argue that Western philosophy is still valued." : (00:23:46.406)
Westman, Claire : "Whether you then say that it should be prioritized over African philosophy in an" : (00:23:51.318)
Westman, Claire : "African context is another question." : (00:23:56.844)
Westman, Claire : "So remember when you're answering this question." : (00:24:00.180)
Westman, Claire : "You can say yes it is justifiable and it is desirable to prioritize Western" : (00:24:04.510)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy and then you give reasons." : (00:24:11.128)
Westman, Claire : "You might say no we should." : (00:24:14.710)
Westman, Claire : "Absolutely not." : (00:24:16.390)
Westman, Claire : "Prioritize Western philosophy and you can give reasons or you can give a more" : (00:24:20.030)
Westman, Claire : "neutral stance where you can say." : (00:24:26.495)
Westman, Claire : "Well, there is value to Western philosophy." : (00:24:29.790)
Westman, Claire : "So This is why we should still incorporate and have a focus on Western" : (00:24:32.710)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy, but at the same time, there must be much more focus and" : (00:24:38.745)
Westman, Claire : "prioritization of African philosophy." : (00:24:44.525)
Westman, Claire : "So that remember there's no one correct answer for these questions." : (00:24:49.150)
Westman, Claire : "You need to consider what your stance is." : (00:24:54.230)
Westman, Claire : "And then you need to develop an argument that supports that argument." : (00:24:59.300)
Westman, Claire : "That claim that you are making OK." : (00:25:04.443)
Westman, Claire : "So that's what we are looking for when we mark your work." : (00:25:06.940)
Westman, Claire : "Have you taken a stance?" : (00:25:11.350)
Westman, Claire : "Have you made a claim? So for example, your claim might be no." : (00:25:12.750)
Westman, Claire : "We must get rid of Western philosophy." : (00:25:16.942)
Westman, Claire : "This. OK. That's a very, very strong claim," : (00:25:19.470)
Westman, Claire : "and you'd need a very good." : (00:25:21.900)
Westman, Claire : "Argument to support that, but you might say no." : (00:25:25.070)
Westman, Claire : "Get rid of Western philosophy entirely." : (00:25:27.150)
Westman, Claire : "Be." : (00:25:28.900)
Westman, Claire : "We then want to see that you have made a very valid, good," : (00:25:29.940)
Westman, Claire : "strong argument to support that claim, OK." : (00:25:34.637)
Westman, Claire : "So we don't." : (00:25:38.220)
Westman, Claire : "We don't." : (00:25:39.420)
Westman, Claire : "We're not marking you on which answer you give." : (00:25:40.460)
Westman, Claire : "It's on how you answer the question, OK?" : (00:25:42.820)
Westman, Claire : "So when you're answering this question, you might say this is the value of" : (00:25:46.100)
Westman, Claire : "Western philosophy." : (00:25:49.292)
Westman, Claire : "This is why it should be prioritized." : (00:25:50.140)
Westman, Claire : "Or this is the value of Western philosophy, and even though it has value." : (00:25:52.340)
Westman, Claire : "In an African context." : (00:25:57.750)
Westman, Claire : "Or even globally, African philosophy should be prioritized" : (00:25:59.420)
Westman, Claire : "For these reasons." : (00:26:03.527)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:26:06.230)
Westman, Claire : "I see a lot of questions or comments coming in," : (00:26:06.390)
Westman, Claire : "so we'll look at them once we are finished with this question." : (00:26:08.881)
Westman, Claire : "So some of the suggestions that you might consider when thinking about prioritising" : (00:26:12.590)
Westman, Claire : "African philosophy is that the ongoing prioritization of Western philosophy." : (00:26:18.726)
Westman, Claire : "Continues to uphold the idea that Africans." : (00:26:26.110)
Westman, Claire : "Aren't capable of engaging in rational philosophical thought," : (00:26:29.540)
Westman, Claire : "so remember that goes back to what I said earlier." : (00:26:33.008)
Westman, Claire : "Prioritising Western philosophy can also lead to the neglect or distortion of" : (00:26:37.310)
Westman, Claire : "indigenous knowledge and therefore African philosophy should be prioritized" : (00:26:43.566)
Westman, Claire : "in African context or even more globally." : (00:26:49.662)
Westman, Claire : "You can argue whichever." : (00:26:52.950)
Westman, Claire : "So because when we are applying." : (00:26:56.550)
Westman, Claire : "Western knowledge to the African context, that means that we are not always" : (00:27:00.140)
Westman, Claire : "considering indigenous knowledge." : (00:27:05.523)
Westman, Claire : "Or knowledge or belief systems." : (00:27:09.710)
Westman, Claire : "Or frameworks that come out of Africa." : (00:27:12.230)
Westman, Claire : "Sometimes we just sort of adapting African knowledge or African beliefs to" : (00:27:15.590)
Westman, Claire : "the Western framework. So we might say that we want to" : (00:27:21.050)
Westman, Claire : "prioritize African philosophy as a way to." : (00:27:25.053)
Westman, Claire : "Prioritize." : (00:27:29.870)
Westman, Claire : "Indigenous knowledge as a way to make sure that we don't neglect or distort" : (00:27:30.380)
Westman, Claire : "African beliefs." : (00:27:36.295)
Westman, Claire : "African knowledge systems, the knowledge and theories that are" : (00:27:37.540)
Westman, Claire : "coming out of Africa." : (00:27:42.670)
Westman, Claire : "And of course, I'm sure you've heard the word decolonize" : (00:27:45.790)
Westman, Claire : "before." : (00:27:49.139)
Westman, Claire : "So the focus, we could argue that the focus should be" : (00:27:51.230)
Westman, Claire : "on African philosophy as a way to decolonize the curriculums and enhance" : (00:27:54.227)
Westman, Claire : "the discourse, the philosophical." : (00:27:58.279)
Westman, Claire : "Knowledge that comes from Africa." : (00:28:00.620)
Westman, Claire : "These are just some suggestions for what you could include in your answer." : (00:28:04.220)
Westman, Claire : "They are not all of them, OK." : (00:28:10.470)
Westman, Claire : "So you are going to, as I say, think about what your answer to that is." : (00:28:12.030)
Westman, Claire : "Is it sustainable?" : (00:28:17.694)
Westman, Claire : "Can this continue in an African context?" : (00:28:19.150)
Westman, Claire : "Can we continue to prioritize Western philosophy when it might not be focusing?" : (00:28:23.030)
Westman, Claire : "On African challenges, African." : (00:28:30.020)
Westman, Claire : "Is it ethically desirable?" : (00:28:34.470)
Westman, Claire : "So here in terms of ethically desirable, we think about ethically," : (00:28:36.670)
Westman, Claire : "is it OK to prioritise Western philosophy in, for example," : (00:28:42.001)
Westman, Claire : "South Africa when it is distorting indigenous knowledge?" : (00:28:46.695)
Westman, Claire : "Is it ethically desirable or is it OK ethically OK to prioritise Western" : (00:28:51.230)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy?" : (00:28:57.696)
Westman, Claire : "When one of the ways it was used was to justify discrimination," : (00:28:59.100)
Westman, Claire : "has that changed over time?" : (00:29:05.374)
Westman, Claire : "So these are some of the things that you're going to be thinking about when" : (00:29:09.990)
Westman, Claire : "you answer this assignment." : (00:29:13.768)
Westman, Claire : "So these are some ideas of what you might consider when you are coming up with your" : (00:29:15.390)
Westman, Claire : "answer." : (00:29:20.154)
Westman, Claire : "Obviously you're all going to give us a different answer," : (00:29:20.910)
Westman, Claire : "and that's like the amazing thing about philosophy, everybody." : (00:29:24.074)
Westman, Claire : "Sort of gets." : (00:29:28.990)
Westman, Claire : "To their own idea and their own claims and their own arguments." : (00:29:29.540)
Westman, Claire : "So we just want to see that you have thought carefully about." : (00:29:33.340)
Westman, Claire : "Those how you feel about those if it's ethically justifiable and if it's" : (00:29:38.550)
Westman, Claire : "sustainable." : (00:29:42.707)
Westman, Claire : "So some things you could think about, I think we won't focus on it too much now" : (00:29:44.780)
Westman, Claire : "because of time, but you might think about how would you" : (00:29:50.729)
Westman, Claire : "define African philosophy?" : (00:29:54.967)
Westman, Claire : "Do you think that African philosophy is prioritised in universities?" : (00:29:58.630)
Westman, Claire : "And obviously again your first year, first semester some of you have done" : (00:30:02.941)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy, maybe at other institutions before you" : (00:30:07.565)
Westman, Claire : "moved to UNICEF." : (00:30:10.751)
Westman, Claire : "But from the little but you know, do you think African philosophy is" : (00:30:12.260)
Westman, Claire : "prioritized?" : (00:30:17.303)
Westman, Claire : "Should African philosophy department or should philosophy departments in Africa" : (00:30:18.820)
Westman, Claire : "focus on Western philosophy or should they focus more on African philosophy?" : (00:30:24.609)
Westman, Claire : "Should Western philosophy be sort of the alternative and African philosophy be the" : (00:30:30.180)
Westman, Claire : "main?" : (00:30:36.632)
Westman, Claire : "Philosophical framework." : (00:30:37.750)
Westman, Claire : "The main philosophical discourse." : (00:30:39.150)
Westman, Claire : "In the departments and how can African philosophy contribute to improving social" : (00:30:41.380)
Westman, Claire : "political economic conditions in Africa?" : (00:30:48.824)
Westman, Claire : "In South Africa, if you wanted to be more specific." : (00:30:52.500)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:30:56.790)
Westman, Claire : "So those that's a bit of the content that you will need in order to answer question" : (00:30:57.110)
Westman, Claire : "one, let me look quickly at the chat in the if" : (00:31:03.198)
Westman, Claire : "you have any questions." : (00:31:06.604)
Westman, Claire : "Please ask them." : (00:31:10.190)
Westman, Claire : "You can put your hand up or you can ask him in the chat." : (00:31:12.690)
Westman, Claire : "OK. So our first comment says, don't you think in a way Western" : (00:31:15.570)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy will forever be dominant considering at the foundation of" : (00:31:19.733)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy was founded by colonizers and we have adopted and lived the way of the" : (00:31:24.220)
Westman, Claire : "West, it would be considerably hard to actually" : (00:31:29.553)
Westman, Claire : "know and establish African." : (00:31:32.674)
Westman, Claire : "Philosophy, unless we dig into the history books," : (00:31:34.430)
Westman, Claire : "which would take time to find out the truth of African philosophy." : (00:31:36.730)
Westman, Claire : "That is a very good point, and that's something that you can" : (00:31:40.550)
Westman, Claire : "consider." : (00:31:42.990)
Westman, Claire : "While you are doing your assignment." : (00:31:43.740)
Westman, Claire : "So." : (00:31:46.790)
Westman, Claire : "A lot of the argument is also that." : (00:31:48.910)
Westman, Claire : "Even people doing African philosophy have been trained in Western philosophy." : (00:31:53.320)
Westman, Claire : "So many, even prominent African philosophers were" : (00:32:00.630)
Westman, Claire : "trained in institutions." : (00:32:04.657)
Westman, Claire : "That only taught Western philosophy, so there's always that argument that even" : (00:32:08.190)
Westman, Claire : "prominent African philosophers are influenced by Western philosophy." : (00:32:13.528)
Westman, Claire : "So that's a very important point." : (00:32:18.870)
Westman, Claire : "It's a very good point." : (00:32:22.660)
Westman, Claire : "And of course, the some of the challenge that we find" : (00:32:25.350)
Westman, Claire : "with African philosophy is that a lot of it was passed down through oral" : (00:32:28.606)
Westman, Claire : "traditions rather than through writing. And so that's one of the reasons that" : (00:32:33.007)
Westman, Claire : "African philosophies, the history of African philosophy," : (00:32:37.709)
Westman, Claire : "can be a bit more." : (00:32:41.145)
Westman, Claire : "Difficult to dig into because there aren't the written records that there are" : (00:32:42.230)
Westman, Claire : "for Western philosophy." : (00:32:46.586)
Westman, Claire : "However, there is a lot of work being done." : (00:32:48.510)
Westman, Claire : "In Africa." : (00:32:52.070)
Westman, Claire : "Philosophy." : (00:32:52.540)
Westman, Claire : "To go back into looking into indigenous knowledge systems into developing African" : (00:32:54.790)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy." : (00:33:01.456)
Westman, Claire : "That." : (00:33:04.750)
Westman, Claire : "Goes back to some pre colonial ideas, some pre colonial beliefs and of course" : (00:33:05.220)
Westman, Claire : "again even that is tricky because we know that colonialism impacted upon." : (00:33:12.733)
Westman, Claire : "Cultures and beliefs and traditions so immensely." : (00:33:21.310)
Westman, Claire : "But this is getting to a much more complex discussion, but very," : (00:33:26.510)
Westman, Claire : "very interesting one." : (00:33:31.559)
Westman, Claire : "And that is a very good comment." : (00:33:33.190)
Westman, Claire : "So thank you very much." : (00:33:36.300)
Westman, Claire : "I think that's something that everybody should kind of think about." : (00:33:37.540)
Westman, Claire : "Is it possible?" : (00:33:41.375)
Westman, Claire : "To move away from." : (00:33:43.910)
Westman, Claire : "Or or to sort of not rely on Western philosophy, at least at this stage." : (00:33:47.590)
Westman, Claire : "Is it possible to only look at African philosophy?" : (00:33:53.383)
Westman, Claire : "Because if we think about things like epistemology, metaphysics, ontology," : (00:33:57.870)
Westman, Claire : "a lot of those ideas." : (00:34:04.027)
Westman, Claire : "Most of those sort of frameworks or theories stem from Western philosophy," : (00:34:06.420)
Westman, Claire : "or at least we learn them through a western philosophical lens," : (00:34:12.019)
Westman, Claire : "because that's what we have written records of." : (00:34:16.797)
Westman, Claire : "So there are many arguments about that." : (00:34:21.460)
Westman, Claire : "But again, we won't go into that." : (00:34:23.140)
Westman, Claire : "But can we even do African philosophy, let's say," : (00:34:25.780)
Westman, Claire : "without having that foundation that we gain from Western philosophy?" : (00:34:28.705)
Westman, Claire : "So that's something for you to think about very carefully." : (00:34:32.740)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:34:38.590)
Westman, Claire : "Oh yes." : (00:34:38.870)
Westman, Claire : "And then the next comment." : (00:34:39.190)
Westman, Claire : "Western philosophy did dilute African culture." : (00:34:40.910)
Westman, Claire : "Yes, absolutely." : (00:34:43.990)
Westman, Claire : "The the arrival of colonizers diluted and distorted and impacted so greatly upon" : (00:34:46.870)
Westman, Claire : "African culture." : (00:34:53.484)
Westman, Claire : "And so it's also even difficult to know now what traditions, beliefs," : (00:34:55.740)
Westman, Claire : "cultures were like pre colonial." : (00:35:01.066)
Westman, Claire : "Again, because a lot of it has been handed down" : (00:35:03.860)
Westman, Claire : "orally." : (00:35:06.793)
Westman, Claire : "And over time, so a lot of it has changed." : (00:35:08.670)
Westman, Claire : "I'm just gonna mute everybody. Somebody's mark is on." : (00:35:14.100)
CASHENY LAMOLA : "Yeah." : (00:35:17.820)
Westman, Claire : "I do see your. I did see your hand up, but I see it's down now." : (00:35:18.500)
Westman, Claire : "Sorry, let me just go back here." : (00:35:24.830)
Westman, Claire : "If you argue that it's not ethically desirable for Western philosophy to" : (00:35:28.350)
Westman, Claire : "maintain its dominance, are you meant to argue that it's rather" : (00:35:32.505)
Westman, Claire : "ethically desirable that African philosophy is dominant," : (00:35:36.147)
Westman, Claire : "or that neither should be?" : (00:35:39.391)
Westman, Claire : "You can't, yes." : (00:35:41.380)
Westman, Claire : "So again, you can say that neither should be" : (00:35:43.910)
Westman, Claire : "dominant, that there should be a balance between" : (00:35:47.140)
Westman, Claire : "Western philosophy and African philosophy." : (00:35:50.656)
Westman, Claire : "You can absolutely argue that you don't have to say just because you say Western" : (00:35:53.670)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy shouldn't be dominant. African philosophy," : (00:35:59.252)
Westman, Claire : "should you do not have to say that you can." : (00:36:02.973)
Westman, Claire : "But you can say African philosophy and Western philosophy." : (00:36:06.005)
Westman, Claire : "Should both be valued." : (00:36:10.340)
Westman, Claire : "There should be a balance between them because both of them bring value to the" : (00:36:11.860)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy departments to philosophy discourse." : (00:36:16.389)
Westman, Claire : "Both of them have important knowledge." : (00:36:19.140)
Westman, Claire : "That can be imparted. OK, so I hope that answers the question." : (00:36:22.950)
Westman, Claire : "Question one." : (00:36:28.110)
Westman, Claire : "Can only use the study guide for reference." : (00:36:28.630)
Westman, Claire : "You can only use the study guide if you find the information in there is all that" : (00:36:30.950)
Westman, Claire : "you need in order to answer the question. So remember." : (00:36:35.835)
Westman, Claire : "The study guide is your main source." : (00:36:40.580)
Westman, Claire : "So you must reference the study guide if you want to look for other sources," : (00:36:44.390)
Westman, Claire : "because you need more information." : (00:36:48.553)
Westman, Claire : "Than you are." : (00:36:51.990)
Westman, Claire : "You can do that, but if you find for this assignment that" : (00:36:52.390)
Westman, Claire : "the study guide is all you need, then you can just focus on the study" : (00:36:56.340)
Westman, Claire : "guide for assessment two. You will need to look at other sources" : (00:37:01.107)
Westman, Claire : "and include evidence from other sources as well." : (00:37:05.534)
Westman, Claire : "OK, how can you reference me?" : (00:37:14.900)
Westman, Claire : "You can reference the recording if you want to," : (00:37:16.580)
Westman, Claire : "but also remember a lot of these ideas come from the study guide." : (00:37:19.814)
Westman, Claire : "And if you do research, you will also find a lot of these ideas" : (00:37:26.230)
Westman, Claire : "in the research, OK?" : (00:37:29.979)
Westman, Claire : "So these are my necessary my ideas." : (00:37:31.150)
Westman, Claire : "They are ideas that you will also find in in research," : (00:37:36.110)
Westman, Claire : "but you can reference the recording if you like." : (00:37:39.791)
Westman, Claire : "Can you argue that Western philosophy taught on the African continent has been" : (00:37:47.380)
Westman, Claire : "influenced by African culture? Given given the forces amalgamation of" : (00:37:52.208)
Westman, Claire : "indigenous with the colonizers?" : (00:37:56.486)
Westman, Claire : "Yes, absolutely." : (00:37:58.380)
Westman, Claire : "So if you want to argue that Western philosophy has been when it was brought" : (00:37:59.660)
Westman, Claire : "to the African continent, it was influenced by African culture." : (00:38:04.881)
Westman, Claire : "It has been influenced by indigenous knowledge systems or African knowledge" : (00:38:09.950)
Westman, Claire : "and beliefs." : (00:38:14.027)
Westman, Claire : "You can argue that that's a very interesting point as well." : (00:38:15.220)
Westman, Claire : "So remember again." : (00:38:19.682)
Westman, Claire : "You can develop any argument that you feel answers those questions," : (00:38:22.790)
Westman, Claire : "or any that does answer those questions. As long as you show how you got to that" : (00:38:27.663)
Westman, Claire : "argument. As long as you've got the reference" : (00:38:33.468)
Westman, Claire : "evidence in there to support your claim." : (00:38:36.764)
Westman, Claire : "S." : (00:38:39.940)
Westman, Claire : "Can I reference a YouTube video?" : (00:38:43.670)
Westman, Claire : "You can reference a YouTube video. Just make sure that it is a credible" : (00:38:45.350)
Westman, Claire : "source." : (00:38:50.163)
Westman, Claire : "So there are for example, some that are done by professors." : (00:38:50.630)
Westman, Claire : "In philosophy, there are some that are done by." : (00:38:54.790)
Westman, Claire : "Sort of learning institution." : (00:38:59.750)
Westman, Claire : "So make sure it's those OK." : (00:39:00.990)
Westman, Claire : "Can we agree African philosophy should be dominant in African communities and not" : (00:39:06.030)
Westman, Claire : "all over the world?" : (00:39:10.025)
Westman, Claire : "Again, yes, you can do that." : (00:39:10.950)
Westman, Claire : "Because again, if we're saying we're looking at" : (00:39:13.580)
Westman, Claire : "challenges in, let's say, for example, Ukraine, because they, you know," : (00:39:17.380)
Westman, Claire : "in a war at the moment." : (00:39:23.080)
Westman, Claire : "The information the knowledge from Africa, maybe we could say is not really relevant" : (00:39:26.430)
Westman, Claire : "to their context." : (00:39:29.830)
Westman, Claire : "Theirs is more sort of Eastern European philosophy or European philosophy is more" : (00:39:32.470)
Westman, Claire : "relevant to them. So you might say that in Africa," : (00:39:37.390)
Westman, Claire : "African philosophy." : (00:39:40.450)
Westman, Claire : "Should." : (00:39:42.980)
Westman, Claire : "Dominant but not everywhere." : (00:39:45.580)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:39:51.920)
Westman, Claire : "Some really, really good points here." : (00:39:53.990)
Westman, Claire : "Yes. So another very good point here from" : (00:40:00.670)
Westman, Claire : "Allison at the end." : (00:40:04.003)
Westman, Claire : "African philosophy existed before Western philosophy," : (00:40:05.510)
Westman, Claire : "but there's no written record of it." : (00:40:08.366)
Westman, Claire : "Very, very good point." : (00:40:10.910)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:40:13.630)
Westman, Claire : "Let me just I'm not going to go through everything because we're running out of" : (00:40:13.790)
Westman, Claire : "time already. Do we have to have a bibliography?" : (00:40:17.313)
Westman, Claire : "Three, yes, absolutely. In text referencing and bibliography," : (00:40:19.540)
Westman, Claire : "is it OK to paraphrase information from AI? No." : (00:40:24.298)
Westman, Claire : "Reference AI no, OK." : (00:40:29.990)
Westman, Claire : "The university has a strict policy against using AI." : (00:40:35.160)
Westman, Claire : "You can use AI maybe to give you an idea of how you want to structure your answer," : (00:40:38.755)
Westman, Claire : "what you want to include." : (00:40:44.385)
Westman, Claire : "But AI is very unreliable." : (00:40:46.080)
Westman, Claire : "Still so often it will give you very vague information." : (00:40:48.920)
Westman, Claire : "Sometimes it gives you incorrect information." : (00:40:56.200)
Westman, Claire : "So there are many, many, many sources that you can use." : (00:40:59.790)
Westman, Claire : "So please don't rely on AI." : (00:41:03.150)
Westman, Claire : "It's like Wikipedia. You can use it as a starting point to" : (00:41:06.020)
Westman, Claire : "give you if you don't know anything about the topic, you can use it as an idea." : (00:41:09.060)
Westman, Claire : "Of sort of help you get an idea of the topic to help you sort of get your mind" : (00:41:14.950)
Westman, Claire : "around it, to think about how to structure your" : (00:41:18.958)
Westman, Claire : "assignment." : (00:41:21.392)
Westman, Claire : "But you should not be actually taking information from an AR source, OK?" : (00:41:22.950)
Westman, Claire : "So be very, very careful of that. And for example, in assignment two," : (00:41:27.670)
Westman, Claire : "when you use turnitin." : (00:41:31.353)
Westman, Claire : "It picks up if you've used AI OK." : (00:41:33.780)
Westman, Claire : "So it's very it's a contentious topic, but please rather look for good" : (00:41:36.340)
Westman, Claire : "information." : (00:41:44.176)
Westman, Claire : "Anything that you find on an AR source is going to be in a credible source." : (00:41:45.500)
Westman, Claire : "So my suggestion is also you can start with the AR to get an idea," : (00:41:50.900)
Westman, Claire : "but go look for those credible sources." : (00:41:56.311)
Westman, Claire : "That then help you to back up that information." : (00:42:00.190)
Westman, Claire : "And make sure you're referencing the credible sources, OK." : (00:42:03.580)
Westman, Claire : "You can if you if you OK." : (00:42:09.740)
Westman, Claire : "It's no OK." : (00:42:12.820)
Westman, Claire : "It's very tricky and it's beyond the scope of this meeting," : (00:42:13.700)
Westman, Claire : "so I'll just leave it at that for now, OK." : (00:42:17.159)
Westman, Claire : "Yes, that's what I'm saying." : (00:42:23.680)
Westman, Claire : "Is that you can use AI as a way to help you start off your understanding," : (00:42:25.440)
Westman, Claire : "but it's not the information you should not be actually using that information in" : (00:42:32.145)
Westman, Claire : "your work." : (00:42:39.574)
Westman, Claire : "You use it to give you a general first idea of what the topic is about," : (00:42:40.600)
Westman, Claire : "so you can." : (00:42:45.771)
Westman, Claire : "It's the same as Wikipedia." : (00:42:46.600)
Westman, Claire : "You cannot reference Wikipedia in." : (00:42:47.960)
Westman, Claire : "Academic work. It's not academic." : (00:42:50.990)
Westman, Claire : "Anybody can write anything on there, but you can go read Wikipedia to get an" : (00:42:53.030)
Westman, Claire : "idea of what the topic is about and then go look at the sources that Wikipedia" : (00:42:57.891)
Westman, Claire : "gives you and go find those sources." : (00:43:02.878)
Westman, Claire : "You can use AI to give you an idea to help you think about how to structure" : (00:43:06.630)
Westman, Claire : "your answer." : (00:43:10.569)
Westman, Claire : "What kind of point you might include, but then when you're referencing in your" : (00:43:11.590)
Westman, Claire : "work, the work you include as referenced" : (00:43:16.349)
Westman, Claire : "evidence needs to come from academic sources." : (00:43:18.819)
Westman, Claire : "If you do use AI to help you brainstorm to help you develop a structure," : (00:43:22.500)
Westman, Claire : "you can give credit to the AI source that you use, but it is very." : (00:43:28.028)
Westman, Claire : "It is a tricky situation right now, so I would suggest avoid AI as much as" : (00:43:35.340)
Westman, Claire : "possible." : (00:43:43.519)
Westman, Claire : "Just because what ends up happening is people submit fully AR answers," : (00:43:44.540)
Westman, Claire : "and then you're going to get 0OK if you submit an answer that has been generated" : (00:43:49.094)
Westman, Claire : "by AI, you will get 0." : (00:43:54.289)
Westman, Claire : "Somebody's mic is on, I think." : (00:43:57.110)
Westman, Claire : "Let me just check again." : (00:43:58.630)
Westman, Claire : "I keep muting them all, but people obviously keep unmuting" : (00:43:59.790)
Westman, Claire : "themselves." : (00:44:03.027)
Westman, Claire : "Beverly, your hand is up." : (00:44:05.170)
Westman, Claire : "You can unmute yourself." : (00:44:12.630)
Westman, Claire : "Beverly." : (00:44:19.610)
Westman, Claire : "Yes, you can use AI as a planning tool." : (00:44:27.970)
Westman, Claire : "OK, Beverly." : (00:44:30.210)
Westman, Claire : "Was it an accidental hand? OK." : (00:44:31.490)
Westman, Claire : "We are running out of time." : (00:44:36.020)
Westman, Claire : "We still have a lot to do, so let's continue, but very good points." : (00:44:37.140)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:44:43.230)
Westman, Claire : "I've mentioned the declaration letter so many times, there is a button," : (00:44:43.550)
Westman, Claire : "a block that you click when you open the assignment." : (00:44:48.550)
Westman, Claire : "That." : (00:44:53.620)
Westman, Claire : "Says that you declare honesty blah blah. You click that," : (00:44:55.830)
Westman, Claire : "but that little block it won't let you submit the assignments until you click" : (00:44:58.583)
Westman, Claire : "that block. That is your honesty declaration," : (00:45:02.350)
Westman, Claire : "so you don't need to include an actual letter in the assignment." : (00:45:04.571)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:45:09.670)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:45:11.750)
Westman, Claire : "So let's move on to the next question because this one is a bit trickier," : (00:45:13.580)
Westman, Claire : "and yet we're running out of time." : (00:45:18.157)
Westman, Claire : "So let's get to this quickly." : (00:45:20.260)
Westman, Claire : "So this question says, drawing on the knowledge you have gained" : (00:45:22.380)
Westman, Claire : "about metaphysics, which means obviously you first need to" : (00:45:26.164)
Westman, Claire : "go and get an understanding of metaph what metaphysics is." : (00:45:29.652)
Westman, Claire : "Explain why the Elysian philosophers should be called metaphysicians." : (00:45:33.660)
Westman, Claire : "You can refer to unit two of the study guide." : (00:45:39.020)
Westman, Claire : "So again, this is asking you about metaphysics," : (00:45:42.510)
Westman, Claire : "and it's asking you about the malesian philosophers." : (00:45:46.046)
Westman, Claire : "So the pre Socratic philosophers and it needs you to explain." : (00:45:50.190)
Westman, Claire : "Why? It could be said that malesian" : (00:45:57.870)
Westman, Claire : "philosophers fell under the bracket of metaphysics," : (00:46:00.121)
Westman, Claire : "while the philosophy they did could be considered metaphysics." : (00:46:03.372)
Westman, Claire : "So in order to answer this question." : (00:46:07.630)
Westman, Claire : "You first need to." : (00:46:11.150)
Westman, Claire : "Explain what metaphysics is." : (00:46:12.020)
Westman, Claire : "You first need to understand what metaphysics is so." : (00:46:14.340)
Westman, Claire : "Just as a note for this question, you will need to look at Pages 8 to 10 of" : (00:46:20.430)
Westman, Claire : "the study guide because that tells you a little bit about epistemology and" : (00:46:25.671)
Westman, Claire : "metaphysics." : (00:46:30.843)
Westman, Claire : "But you will probably need to go do your own bit of research about metaphysics for" : (00:46:31.950)
Westman, Claire : "this question." : (00:46:37.221)
Westman, Claire : "But page 8 to 10 of the study guide." : (00:46:38.110)
Westman, Claire : "And then the information about the Malaysian philosophers is on page 23 to" : (00:46:41.160)
Westman, Claire : "31." : (00:46:47.160)
Westman, Claire : "So that's the focus for of the study guide for this question. For question one," : (00:46:47.880)
Westman, Claire : "I didn't mention this then 12 pages 12 to 21 are where you should focus your" : (00:46:53.686)
Westman, Claire : "attention." : (00:46:59.275)
Westman, Claire : "For question one, OK." : (00:47:01.550)
Westman, Claire : "So there's a hand up Luanda." : (00:47:03.150)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "Yeah. Sorry, ma'am. I just missed the second set of pages for" : (00:47:08.270)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "mesophysics." : (00:47:12.795)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:47:14.400)
Westman, Claire : "So it's pages 8 to 10." : (00:47:14.800)
Westman, Claire : "And pages 23 to 31." : (00:47:18.110)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "OK." : (00:47:18.460)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "OK." : (00:47:23.450)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "Thank you." : (00:47:23.850)
Westman, Claire : "It's a pleasure." : (00:47:24.630)
Westman, Claire : "OK, so to define metaphysics is quite tricky." : (00:47:26.830)
Westman, Claire : "There's no single definition of metaphysics, and it's changed over time." : (00:47:31.310)
Westman, Claire : "So what might have been considered metaphysics at one point?" : (00:47:35.790)
Westman, Claire : "So sort of. During the ancient Greek philosoph" : (00:47:40.910)
Westman, Claire : "philosophers time, it sort of changed somewhat." : (00:47:43.938)
Westman, Claire : "Some of it is the same. There's been sort of additional ideas of" : (00:47:47.030)
Westman, Claire : "what constitutes metaphysics or what falls under metaphysics." : (00:47:50.900)
Westman, Claire : "So it has changed over time." : (00:47:55.380)
Westman, Claire : "So this is 1 aspect of this question that might be a little bit tricky for you," : (00:47:56.940)
Westman, Claire : "but let's look at some of the definitions that we can find through doing a bit of" : (00:48:02.620)
Westman, Claire : "research on the Internet so metaphysics can generally most generally it's" : (00:48:08.442)
Westman, Claire : "understood as OK, I hope." : (00:48:13.696)
Westman, Claire : "You can hear me." : (00:48:15.470)
Westman, Claire : "There's a weed eater that's really loud outside." : (00:48:15.740)
Westman, Claire : "It's generally understood as the branch of philosophy that examines the" : (00:48:20.940)
Westman, Claire : "fundamental nature of reality." : (00:48:25.571)
Westman, Claire : "There's another hand." : (00:48:29.790)
Westman, Claire : "Arpa C is a question for now." : (00:48:31.030)
Westman, Claire : "Oh, OK." : (00:48:36.830)
Westman, Claire : "I'm going to come back to questions at the end." : (00:48:37.150)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:48:39.110)
Westman, Claire : "So let's just get through this and then we'll deal with questions at the end." : (00:48:39.430)
Westman, Claire : "So it's generally the branch of philosophy that examines fundamental" : (00:48:46.710)
Westman, Claire : "nature of reality." : (00:48:50.137)
Westman, Claire : "So what do we understand by reality?" : (00:48:51.340)
Westman, Claire : "What sort of things are real?" : (00:48:54.900)
Westman, Claire : "What do we know about what's real?" : (00:48:57.340)
Westman, Claire : "So other definitions that might make this a bit clearer for you are it's the study" : (00:48:59.980)
Westman, Claire : "of the nature of reality or of what sort of things are real," : (00:49:06.152)
Westman, Claire : "but seeks to understand basic criteria or first principles for determining what" : (00:49:10.688)
Westman, Claire : "sort of things are real." : (00:49:16.636)
Westman, Claire : "So it can address topics such as space and time." : (00:49:19.150)
Westman, Claire : "Time determinism and free will, God minded matter," : (00:49:22.060)
Westman, Claire : "identity and change and more so you can see it's very broad metaphysics and we" : (00:49:26.519)
Westman, Claire : "know it incorporates." : (00:49:33.425)
Westman, Claire : "Other branches of philosophy." : (00:49:36.870)
Westman, Claire : "Another definition says it is the science that studies being as such," : (00:49:39.830)
Westman, Claire : "or the first causes of things." : (00:49:45.010)
Westman, Claire : "So now some of these things I've highlighted will be important for this" : (00:49:47.230)
Westman, Claire : "question." : (00:49:50.822)
Westman, Claire : "Or things that do not change." : (00:49:52.210)
Westman, Claire : "The final one I've got here is it's a division of philosophy that is concerned" : (00:49:55.830)
Westman, Claire : "with the fundamental nature of reality and being." : (00:50:00.632)
Westman, Claire : "It includes ontology, cosmology and often epistemology." : (00:50:03.790)
Westman, Claire : "It's a study of what is outside objective experience, so it's trying to understand." : (00:50:09.390)
Westman, Claire : "What? What constitutes reality?" : (00:50:17.270)
Westman, Claire : "What things are real?" : (00:50:21.380)
Westman, Claire : "What makes up those things that are real?" : (00:50:24.350)
Westman, Claire : "What are the sort of substances that we can understand for things that are real," : (00:50:26.790)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:50:32.460)
Westman, Claire : "So what makes up our reality?" : (00:50:32.670)
Westman, Claire : "And very importantly, here is to take note of things like the" : (00:50:36.180)
Westman, Claire : "first causes of things, because as we are going to see," : (00:50:41.213)
Westman, Claire : "that is the focus of Malaysian philosophy was trying to understand the causes of" : (00:50:45.758)
Westman, Claire : "things." : (00:50:52.332)
Westman, Claire : "So what is it that causes something to be something to exist?" : (00:50:53.980)
Westman, Claire : "How do we understand the world that we are living in? How do we understand?" : (00:51:00.500)
Westman, Claire : "The things around us." : (00:51:06.860)
Westman, Claire : "How how do we understand the fundamental nature?" : (00:51:10.580)
Westman, Claire : "So what is it that gives things the fundamental nature?" : (00:51:14.140)
Westman, Claire : "What? What is the substance that makes things" : (00:51:17.740)
Westman, Claire : "real or gives us our nature?" : (00:51:21.023)
Westman, Claire : "Gives us reality." : (00:51:23.990)
Westman, Claire : "So go and do some research on metaphysics." : (00:51:26.770)
Westman, Claire : "And there are also lots of videos that you can watch." : (00:51:30.530)
Westman, Claire : "That will help you, OK." : (00:51:35.690)
Westman, Claire : "I've included some suggested sources at the towards the end of the slides that" : (00:51:37.290)
Westman, Claire : "you can use also to help you. OK, we are definitely going to go over time" : (00:51:42.160)
Westman, Claire : "here, so I hope that's OK with everybody. Obviously," : (00:51:46.720)
Westman, Claire : "if you need to leave then you're welcome to leave." : (00:51:49.987)
Westman, Claire : "Hey, catch up on the recording. Next week's class will be short." : (00:51:55.370)
Westman, Claire : "Because just one question." : (00:51:59.210)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:52:01.100)
Westman, Claire : "So an overview of the Malaysian." : (00:52:01.740)
Westman, Claire : "They called sort of the Ironian school or the museum because it from they were from" : (00:52:06.020)
Westman, Claire : "Malaysia." : (00:52:11.946)
Westman, Claire : "And that was part of Ancient Greece." : (00:52:15.020)
Westman, Claire : "It would actually be part of Turkey now, but that's not so important for you to" : (00:52:16.940)
Westman, Claire : "know now." : (00:52:21.435)
Westman, Claire : "So the the main thing that the Malaysians were doing was trying to move away from" : (00:52:24.110)
Westman, Claire : "myth and superstition." : (00:52:29.314)
Westman, Claire : "So there were many mythological understandings of the nature of the world" : (00:52:30.830)
Westman, Claire : "and of things that we experienced. They experienced in the world a lot of" : (00:52:36.267)
Westman, Claire : "their understanding of those stem from myth, from superstition," : (00:52:41.704)
Westman, Claire : "from ideas around the gods." : (00:52:46.407)
Westman, Claire : "So the Malaysians were trying to move away from that to have a more rational" : (00:52:49.140)
Westman, Claire : "understanding." : (00:52:53.134)
Westman, Claire : "Of what they were experiencing or the things they could observe," : (00:52:54.770)
Westman, Claire : "the patterns they could observe that were happening around them in the world." : (00:52:59.389)
Westman, Claire : "So, for example, myth had been used to explain many" : (00:53:05.130)
Westman, Claire : "natural phenomena. Let's say, for example Thunder." : (00:53:08.624)
Westman, Claire : "Mythologically or during those times it might have been explained that Thunder" : (00:53:14.460)
Westman, Claire : "was caused by God's the various gods anger." : (00:53:20.395)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:53:24.210)
Westman, Claire : "So that's where Thunder might have come from." : (00:53:24.410)
Westman, Claire : "They had many gods to explain the different natural phenomena." : (00:53:28.060)
Westman, Claire : "So the Malaysians wanted to have these more rational moving towards scientific" : (00:53:31.940)
Westman, Claire : "understandings of an explanations for national natural phenomena." : (00:53:37.203)
Westman, Claire : "So for example, they could see that there was these" : (00:53:41.599)
Westman, Claire : "patterns like the tides coming in and out." : (00:53:45.063)
Westman, Claire : "So they didn't." : (00:53:48.220)
Westman, Claire : "They thought that there was rational explanations for why the tides came in" : (00:53:49.180)
Westman, Claire : "and out." : (00:53:53.740)
Westman, Claire : "Out, rather than saying that it was because of" : (00:53:54.530)
Westman, Claire : "the gods or some other, some other kind of superstitious reason" : (00:53:57.367)
Westman, Claire : "or mythological reason that the tides moved in and out," : (00:54:01.230)
Westman, Claire : "they wanted to have a more rational understanding of that." : (00:54:04.610)
Westman, Claire : "You know, they might have also seen the crops grew" : (00:54:10.820)
Westman, Claire : "at certain times of the year where in mythologically that might have been that" : (00:54:13.448)
Westman, Claire : "would have been attributed to one of the gods, you know," : (00:54:17.518)
Westman, Claire : "blessing the harvest and the crops sprouting during that time." : (00:54:20.455)
Westman, Claire : "The Malaysian philosophers wanted to understand what is it?" : (00:54:24.410)
Westman, Claire : "About nature or these phenomena that causes the crops to arise at that time." : (00:54:30.780)
Westman, Claire : "So they wanted to develop a more rational understanding." : (00:54:35.460)
Westman, Claire : "So the fundamental question that the Malaysians asked is what is the first" : (00:54:40.860)
Westman, Claire : "governing principle of the world by which chaos." : (00:54:45.191)
Westman, Claire : "Is turned into Cosmos or intelligible matter." : (00:54:49.740)
Westman, Claire : "So what is the the thing that underlies?" : (00:54:52.530)
Westman, Claire : "What is the substance that underlies everything that gives it?" : (00:54:55.210)
Westman, Claire : "That gives patterns that contribute to it being understandable?" : (00:55:00.231)
Westman, Claire : "So going from sort of just seeing all these wild, random, unintelligible," : (00:55:05.370)
Westman, Claire : "chaotic aspects of nature of natural phenomena, all these while, you know," : (00:55:10.575)
Westman, Claire : "unformed things happening around us in the natural world." : (00:55:15.851)
Westman, Claire : "What is the thing that governs that?" : (00:55:20.700)
Westman, Claire : "That gives an order that makes it intelligible that forms it," : (00:55:22.610)
Westman, Claire : "that brings it together." : (00:55:27.599)
Westman, Claire : "So that is what they were trying to understand." : (00:55:29.730)
Westman, Claire : "So they wanted to understand what it was that governed observable patterns or from" : (00:55:33.181)
Westman, Claire : "which natural phenomena and consequently nature of being emerged." : (00:55:39.146)
Westman, Claire : "So they wanted to understand what was the underlying substance." : (00:55:44.010)
Westman, Claire : "That led to or governed observable patterns or that led." : (00:55:48.180)
Westman, Claire : "Two natural phenomena that they could observe," : (00:55:52.730)
Westman, Claire : "so they get sought to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature" : (00:55:55.943)
Westman, Claire : "of reality." : (00:56:01.138)
Westman, Claire : "And so again, they wanted to look at sort of this" : (00:56:03.260)
Westman, Claire : "objective thing that was outside of what they could experience." : (00:56:06.155)
Westman, Claire : "So what was it that underlay or underpinned all of these phenomena that" : (00:56:09.900)
Westman, Claire : "they could see?" : (00:56:15.230)
Westman, Claire : "And they were generally monists, which means that they believe all of" : (00:56:16.740)
Westman, Claire : "reality." : (00:56:21.192)
Westman, Claire : "Is composed of one single unifying substance." : (00:56:21.890)
Westman, Claire : "So we might think that these ideas." : (00:56:26.290)
Westman, Claire : "Are sort of silly now, or ludicrous when we look at the ideas" : (00:56:30.460)
Westman, Claire : "that they came up with." : (00:56:33.991)
Westman, Claire : "But we must think about the time at which they were developing these ideas." : (00:56:35.340)
Westman, Claire : "So like I said, a lot of the understanding of the natural" : (00:56:41.900)
Westman, Claire : "world of the reality was based on myth on." : (00:56:47.004)
Westman, Claire : "Sort of." : (00:56:52.620)
Westman, Claire : "Of thinking that the gods produced the phenomena," : (00:56:53.250)
Westman, Claire : "they saw that the gods controlled all the natural phenomena that they could see" : (00:56:56.487)
Westman, Claire : "happening around them." : (00:57:01.666)
Westman, Claire : "And that Malaysians wanted to develop this more rational idea." : (00:57:04.740)
Westman, Claire : "But it was at a time when not like now." : (00:57:08.446)
Westman, Claire : "And we have scientific explanations for a lot of what we experience." : (00:57:10.740)
Westman, Claire : "They didn't have those scientific explanations." : (00:57:15.300)
Westman, Claire : "So when we look at their ideas now, with the knowledge that we have." : (00:57:18.420)
Westman, Claire : "Now we might think they silly, but we must think about how important." : (00:57:23.650)
Westman, Claire : "These kind of rational inquiries or these inquiries towards a more rational" : (00:57:30.180)
Westman, Claire : "explanation, were at the time and how they helped move" : (00:57:35.528)
Westman, Claire : "knowledge forward and helped to contribute to sort of scientific inquiry" : (00:57:39.398)
Westman, Claire : "to the development of the scientific method." : (00:57:44.534)
Westman, Claire : "To developing these objective understandings." : (00:57:49.300)
Westman, Claire : "Of reality of how things work, of what causes the things that we can see" : (00:57:53.450)
Westman, Claire : "happening around us, or that we can experience." : (00:57:59.580)
Westman, Claire : "So instead of just our subjective experiences that we as an individual" : (00:58:03.970)
Westman, Claire : "experience, what is it that lays the foundation?" : (00:58:09.627)
Westman, Claire : "What is the foundation of these things that everybody experiences?" : (00:58:13.530)
Westman, Claire : "In their own way." : (00:58:18.660)
Westman, Claire : "But what causes these phenomena?" : (00:58:19.940)
Westman, Claire : "What causes this reality?" : (00:58:22.660)
Westman, Claire : "Or this the natural world around us?" : (00:58:24.210)
Westman, Claire : "So keep that in mind while you're working through the Malaysians because as I say" : (00:58:28.860)
Westman, Claire : "to us, it now seems a bit silly these ideas," : (00:58:34.057)
Westman, Claire : "but at the time this was, you know, a huge sort of leap in trying to" : (00:58:36.909)
Westman, Claire : "understand the world and trying to understand reality and." : (00:58:41.281)
Westman, Claire : "To have a better grasp of the nature of reality, OK?" : (00:58:45.020)
Westman, Claire : "So the first one, the first Malaysian we'll get is Thais." : (00:58:50.500)
Westman, Claire : "He was a mathematician and an astronomer, and he wanted to discover and explain the" : (00:58:55.850)
Westman, Claire : "origins, the material origins of life in the world." : (00:59:01.385)
Westman, Claire : "So he's had made observations of living things around him," : (00:59:06.300)
Westman, Claire : "and he noted that living things were either comprised of water or humidity," : (00:59:10.266)
Westman, Claire : "or they needed water or weakness to survive and to thrive." : (00:59:15.375)
Westman, Claire : "He also, by looking at all of these, the living things around him noted." : (00:59:19.700)
Westman, Claire : "Dying so things living, things that were dying or dead or" : (00:59:25.970)
Westman, Claire : "inanimate objects, say let's say." : (00:59:31.503)
Westman, Claire : "What Mark David had a cloth." : (00:59:36.340)
Westman, Claire : "They were." : (00:59:40.900)
Westman, Claire : "They either were dry or they became dry." : (00:59:42.540)
Westman, Claire : "And again, it'll explain to you in the study guide" : (00:59:45.500)
Westman, Claire : "that at the time they were in a very dry desert like conditions." : (00:59:47.962)
Westman, Claire : "So water was considered so important it was considered sort of the thing that" : (00:59:51.100)
Westman, Claire : "gave life." : (00:59:55.851)
Westman, Claire : "So when Thadis was looking at things around him that were living, he was like," : (00:59:56.900)
Westman, Claire : "OK, they either are made-up of water or" : (01:00:02.389)
Westman, Claire : "they're humid." : (01:00:05.168)
Westman, Claire : "Or they need water." : (01:00:07.140)
Westman, Claire : "Or some kind of wetness in order to survive." : (01:00:08.020)
Westman, Claire : "So because of these observations he made about the importance of water." : (01:00:11.450)
Westman, Claire : "He determined that water was the underlying first principle." : (01:00:17.180)
Westman, Claire : "So he thought that water was what life originated from." : (01:00:20.500)
Westman, Claire : "From so he thought that water was the thing that led to the existence of" : (01:00:26.370)
Westman, Claire : "everything that was living in the world." : (01:00:32.495)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:00:36.050)
Westman, Claire : "So the material origin of life and the world he thought was water." : (01:00:36.730)
Westman, Claire : "So water formed the foundation of every living thing he believed." : (01:00:42.700)
Westman, Claire : "And of the world in general. And so, for example," : (01:00:47.940)
Westman, Claire : "he went so far as to think that the Earth rested upon water, so he." : (01:00:51.025)
Westman, Claire : "Thought that where earthquakes mythologically were considered to be the" : (01:00:55.610)
Westman, Claire : "anger of the gods, he thought that earthquakes were the" : (01:01:00.218)
Westman, Claire : "result of water rocking beneath the Earth." : (01:01:03.802)
Westman, Claire : "So he thought the earth was on this body of water," : (01:01:06.490)
Westman, Claire : "and that when the water moved and shook the earth would rock on top of it." : (01:01:09.781)
Westman, Claire : "And that is what an earthquake was. Again, we can see that, obviously," : (01:01:14.621)
Westman, Claire : "scientifically." : (01:01:19.203)
Westman, Claire : "We have been geologically, we've moved far beyond that understanding." : (01:01:20.860)
Westman, Claire : "But we do know that." : (01:01:26.290)
Westman, Claire : "But at the time, this was sort of a revolutionary idea, OK." : (01:01:30.500)
Westman, Claire : "So for Thales, the one single unifying substance." : (01:01:35.100)
Westman, Claire : "So the single unifying substance that all reality is composed of for thalese was" : (01:01:42.260)
Westman, Claire : "water because of the necessity of water for living things." : (01:01:48.324)
Westman, Claire : "OK. And then the other natural phenomena" : (01:01:53.770)
Westman, Claire : "could be explained again by water." : (01:01:56.176)
Westman, Claire : "So there are some examples in the study guide that you can go look at the." : (01:01:58.330)
Westman, Claire : "Also if you go look online, you can find other examples," : (01:02:03.992)
Westman, Claire : "but for example it was water sprouting from a spring water rocking the earth," : (01:02:08.294)
Westman, Claire : "creating earthquakes etc. OK." : (01:02:14.181)
Westman, Claire : "Anax Amanda is the second one." : (01:02:18.180)
Westman, Claire : "We'll look at so he." : (01:02:19.820)
Westman, Claire : "Went against dailies because remember, dailies now thought that Earth sat on top" : (01:02:23.490)
Westman, Claire : "of water and anax. Amanda was actually quite ahead of his" : (01:02:29.925)
Westman, Claire : "time." : (01:02:34.533)
Westman, Claire : "Because he thought that there's nothing under the Earth supporting it." : (01:02:35.050)
Westman, Claire : "He thought that it floats in the centre of the universe and that what keeps it" : (01:02:39.410)
Westman, Claire : "floating in the centre of universe is that it's equal distance from." : (01:02:44.577)
Westman, Claire : "Other worlds other." : (01:02:50.060)
Westman, Claire : "Other." : (01:02:55.020)
Westman, Claire : "On my way, I'm just gonna set obstacles." : (01:02:56.400)
Westman, Claire : "That's not the word." : (01:02:58.120)
Westman, Claire : "Other objects in the universe, so he thought that it was at an equal" : (01:02:59.810)
Westman, Claire : "distance from other objects which might have been other worlds." : (01:03:03.151)
Westman, Claire : "And because of that sort of force on the earth from those other worlds or objects," : (01:03:06.330)
Westman, Claire : "that's what supported that." : (01:03:11.914)
Westman, Claire : "What kept the earth floating in the universe?" : (01:03:13.730)
Westman, Claire : "And I mean, that was such a revolutionary idea." : (01:03:16.090)
Westman, Claire : "And it's, you know, definitely sort of starting to work" : (01:03:18.450)
Westman, Claire : "towards sort of." : (01:03:23.242)
Westman, Claire : "Ideas of gravity and all of that?" : (01:03:25.660)
Westman, Claire : "But at the time it sort of just." : (01:03:27.940)
Westman, Claire : "Kept it simple." : (01:03:29.930)
Westman, Claire : "He also thought that the Earth was sort of a long tube and that the inhabitable" : (01:03:31.170)
Westman, Claire : "earth was almost like a plate on top of the tube." : (01:03:37.423)
Westman, Claire : "So again, you know not a full understanding of." : (01:03:41.610)
Westman, Claire : "The earth, obviously, but a big leap in what was understood" : (01:03:47.940)
Westman, Claire : "about the Earth or the thinking about the universe and the earth." : (01:03:51.864)
Westman, Claire : "So Anax, Amanda didn't think that water." : (01:03:58.060)
Westman, Claire : "That was the stylist was his teacher." : (01:04:01.010)
Westman, Claire : "But he didn't think that water was that what Earth originated from," : (01:04:04.330)
Westman, Claire : "or that everything originated on from." : (01:04:08.333)
Westman, Claire : "Heath thought it was the a pyron, so the apparent could be understand as" : (01:04:10.570)
Westman, Claire : "infinite unlimited indefinite." : (01:04:15.248)
Westman, Claire : "So you didn't think it was one particular element?" : (01:04:17.170)
Westman, Claire : "Instead, he thought it was the a pyron which was" : (01:04:20.570)
Westman, Claire : "which he thought was this boundless." : (01:04:23.983)
Westman, Claire : "So just forever reaching expands of infinitely different substances." : (01:04:27.420)
Westman, Claire : "So he thought there was this. The universe was just this expanse." : (01:04:33.330)
Westman, Claire : "Of substances that could never be finished would never end." : (01:04:39.820)
Westman, Claire : "So, you know, like an infinite number and kind of" : (01:04:44.140)
Westman, Claire : "substances that could not be created or destroyed." : (01:04:47.428)
Westman, Claire : "And he thought that everything grew out of the apyron." : (01:04:50.780)
Westman, Claire : "So, I mean, we know the universe is sort of infinite" : (01:04:56.100)
Westman, Claire : "and expansive. For him it was." : (01:05:00.213)
Westman, Claire : "Had all these substances and in the world or earth would come," : (01:05:02.810)
Westman, Claire : "would be a coming together of those substances," : (01:05:06.026)
Westman, Claire : "that's how the earth would grow out of the appyron." : (01:05:08.476)
Westman, Claire : "So he thought that the earth that he inhabited was not." : (01:05:11.730)
Westman, Claire : "The only earth and he didn't think our world would always exist." : (01:05:19.420)
Westman, Claire : "He didn't think it had always existed because there was a number." : (01:05:23.340)
Westman, Claire : "Of worlds that would." : (01:05:29.500)
Westman, Claire : "Come to exist and then would not always exist and they would grow out of the" : (01:05:32.700)
Westman, Claire : "sapyron." : (01:05:36.940)
Westman, Claire : "So he thought the earth grew out of the appyron and that it wouldn't always exist." : (01:05:37.780)
Westman, Claire : "And that other worlds would then grow out of the apyra." : (01:05:42.580)
Westman, Claire : "And interestingly, he also started to think about evolution." : (01:05:47.140)
Westman, Claire : "So he thought that the life that he could observe so the plants, animals, humans," : (01:05:51.300)
Westman, Claire : "etc. Must have originated from other life" : (01:05:57.305)
Westman, Claire : "forms." : (01:06:00.381)
Westman, Claire : "So he said that the first life forms must have originated in wetter environments" : (01:06:01.610)
Westman, Claire : "and then evolved into what he what existed during his time," : (01:06:06.441)
Westman, Claire : "what he could observe and for example, he thought that humans evolved from fish." : (01:06:10.020)
Westman, Claire : "So again, very revolutionary ideas for the time" : (01:06:14.930)
Westman, Claire : "where everything was attributed to the gods or myth or superstition." : (01:06:18.445)
Westman, Claire : "He started to have these more sort of scientific understandings of reality," : (01:06:23.496)
Westman, Claire : "of the nature of reality." : (01:06:29.060)
Westman, Claire : "And this movement towards a sort of scientific view of the world." : (01:06:33.260)
Westman, Claire : "And then finally, was annex Aminis. He thought a was the single substance." : (01:06:39.010)
Westman, Claire : "So where we had failies thought it was water and axaminis thought it was air." : (01:06:45.980)
Westman, Claire : "And he thought that constituted all things." : (01:06:50.980)
Westman, Claire : "So he said that the change of one thing into another," : (01:06:53.809)
Westman, Claire : "so the change of anything into something else." : (01:06:57.279)
Westman, Claire : "Is simply an indication of a change in the density of a." : (01:07:01.940)
Westman, Claire : "So for example, he thought that a." : (01:07:05.300)
Westman, Claire : "When it condensed, it formed clouds and that led to rain." : (01:07:08.610)
Westman, Claire : "So a change in the density of air results in water," : (01:07:12.410)
Westman, Claire : "and again there are some other examples." : (01:07:16.073)
Westman, Claire : "So a lot of these ideas that the Malaysians gave." : (01:07:19.530)
Westman, Claire : "Were not fully explained and you know can be quite difficult to grasp because they" : (01:07:27.580)
Westman, Claire : "didn't give full explanations, so not exactly clear why he thought it" : (01:07:32.916)
Westman, Claire : "was air or how." : (01:07:37.416)
Westman, Claire : "You know, air led to everything." : (01:07:38.890)
Westman, Claire : "That exists in reality, but that was the sort of 1 unifying" : (01:07:42.250)
Westman, Claire : "substance that exists." : (01:07:47.226)
Westman, Claire : "Thought was what constituted all things that existed in reality." : (01:07:49.050)
Westman, Claire : "OK, so for this question you need to have" : (01:07:55.660)
Westman, Claire : "sort of an understanding of those of the these three malesions." : (01:07:59.369)
Westman, Claire : "You don't need to at this time." : (01:08:05.100)
Westman, Claire : "Look at Pomenetis or Heracles." : (01:08:06.700)
Westman, Claire : "Just these three malesions." : (01:08:08.810)
Westman, Claire : "But then you need to think about, OK." : (01:08:12.290)
Westman, Claire : "What is it about the kinds of philosoph philosophical thought that the malesians" : (01:08:15.210)
Westman, Claire : "had that ties back into metaphysics?" : (01:08:21.995)
Westman, Claire : "So let's look at this again." : (01:08:26.540)
Westman, Claire : "So if we think about the kinds of philosophy that they would take that they" : (01:08:29.220)
Westman, Claire : "were engaged in, they were thinking about." : (01:08:33.832)
Westman, Claire : "First principles." : (01:08:38.060)
Westman, Claire : "So while they think about what is real, what is the fundamental nature of reality?" : (01:08:39.170)
Westman, Claire : "Very importantly, sort of the first causes of things or." : (01:08:46.580)
Westman, Claire : "The the governing principles of things. It involved things like." : (01:08:53.300)
Westman, Claire : "Epistemology and ontology, which are obviously like what we know and" : (01:08:59.820)
Westman, Claire : "how we know. So. So what, what exists in the world." : (01:09:04.542)
Westman, Claire : "And how do we know about what exists and also things like cosmology?" : (01:09:09.110)
Westman, Claire : "If you think about how they, for example, an exam thought about how." : (01:09:14.370)
Westman, Claire : "Earth fits into the bigger universe, so he thought that Earth fits into this" : (01:09:21.140)
Westman, Claire : "bigger universe and Earth grew from this bigger universe and it existed in a" : (01:09:25.412)
Westman, Claire : "universe with other worlds." : (01:09:29.683)
Westman, Claire : "So that's a kind of a cosmology, and they were also trying to think of" : (01:09:31.340)
Westman, Claire : "what is outside of objective experience." : (01:09:36.023)
Westman, Claire : "So what is it that we can explain?" : (01:09:38.930)
Westman, Claire : "How can we explain?" : (01:09:45.050)
Westman, Claire : "Reality or what is real or or what we experience and observe." : (01:09:47.770)
Westman, Claire : "How can we explain that on a much sort of bigger level?" : (01:09:52.530)
Westman, Claire : "How can we explain what is at the core?" : (01:09:57.490)
Westman, Claire : "What is fundamental to things that are real," : (01:10:01.170)
Westman, Claire : "and obviously a lot of this has changed over time from the Malaysians." : (01:10:04.196)
Westman, Claire : "We don't have necessarily the same understandings." : (01:10:08.970)
Westman, Claire : "We don't think that." : (01:10:12.130)
Westman, Claire : "All of life springs from water." : (01:10:14.020)
Westman, Claire : "Necessarily, we also know that not everything is made" : (01:10:16.290)
Westman, Claire : "just from air." : (01:10:21.659)
Westman, Claire : "So some of that has changed. We know more about sort of the Earth and" : (01:10:24.130)
Westman, Claire : "why it floats and what the earth is comprised of." : (01:10:29.684)
Westman, Claire : "Think about these elements of metaphysics and how they tie into what the Malaysians." : (01:10:35.390)
Westman, Claire : "Were looking at in their philosophical inquiries. OK, the origin of the world." : (01:10:45.690)
Westman, Claire : "What? What is the foundation of reality?" : (01:10:52.010)
Westman, Claire : "What? What were the substances that things were" : (01:10:53.770)
Westman, Claire : "made of that made things real?" : (01:10:57.414)
Westman, Claire : "So for this question you need to 1st think about what is metaphysics." : (01:11:00.210)
Westman, Claire : "Then you need to think about. You need to give an explanation of what" : (01:11:05.440)
Westman, Claire : "the Malaysians." : (01:11:09.295)
Westman, Claire : "Their their ideas." : (01:11:11.890)
Westman, Claire : "And then you need to bring that together to say based on these understandings of" : (01:11:12.810)
Westman, Claire : "metaphysics and these aspects of malesian thought." : (01:11:18.309)
Westman, Claire : "This is why the MALESIANS could be considered metaphysicians." : (01:11:22.130)
Westman, Claire : "This is why males and philosophical inquiry could be considered metaphysical." : (01:11:26.530)
Westman, Claire : "OK, so I hope that makes sense." : (01:11:34.910)
Westman, Claire : "So some things again you can think about this might come in later," : (01:11:37.150)
Westman, Claire : "but do you agree with any of the malesion philosophers ideas?" : (01:11:41.118)
Westman, Claire : "Does it show an important step in the development of philosophical thinking and" : (01:11:46.210)
Westman, Claire : "also scientific thinking?" : (01:11:49.776)
Westman, Claire : "And what aspects of metaphysics are evidence in malesian inquiries?" : (01:11:51.170)
Westman, Claire : "OK so." : (01:11:57.810)
Westman, Claire : "That's sort of to help you with that question." : (01:12:00.530)
Westman, Claire : "And I know again that it can be quite tricky to understand," : (01:12:03.880)
Westman, Claire : "especially because it is very different from our understandings of nature and" : (01:12:08.024)
Westman, Claire : "reality now." : (01:12:13.412)
Westman, Claire : "So again, please use any resources that are" : (01:12:15.730)
Westman, Claire : "available to you." : (01:12:19.048)
Westman, Claire : "Again, I'll show you some sources that are quite" : (01:12:20.330)
Westman, Claire : "useful, like some good YouTube videos." : (01:12:23.462)
Westman, Claire : "Some." : (01:12:27.530)
Westman, Claire : "Websites that give sort of more simplistic or." : (01:12:29.330)
Westman, Claire : "More." : (01:12:33.890)
Westman, Claire : "Or maybe even more detailed explanations that you can use to help you. OK," : (01:12:34.480)
Westman, Claire : "so let me just look at the chat quickly. If you write more than 300 words," : (01:12:38.908)
Westman, Claire : "Please remember to make sure that everything you have included is necessary." : (01:12:43.335)
Westman, Claire : "Um, you can go a little bit over 300 words," : (01:12:50.490)
Westman, Claire : "but if it's too much over then it's likely that you've included too much" : (01:12:53.819)
Westman, Claire : "information." : (01:12:59.343)
Westman, Claire : "Only focus on the most important information." : (01:13:00.330)
Westman, Claire : "OK so." : (01:13:05.730)
Westman, Claire : "For this question says, should we use a meaning that's five or" : (01:13:08.490)
Westman, Claire : "ten years recent?" : (01:13:11.294)
Westman, Claire : "I assume you mean for the definition for metaphysics, so." : (01:13:13.280)
Westman, Claire : "In philosophy, well in most studies." : (01:13:18.850)
Westman, Claire : "Sorry, in most studies we would say used" : (01:13:22.970)
Westman, Claire : "information that is recent." : (01:13:26.009)
Westman, Claire : "However, we must remember that philosophy stems" : (01:13:29.610)
Westman, Claire : "back." : (01:13:32.726)
Westman, Claire : "Well, you know this sort of philosophy we're" : (01:13:33.330)
Westman, Claire : "looking at stems back like over 2000 years." : (01:13:36.041)
Westman, Claire : "So you're not always going to be using very recent sources." : (01:13:38.850)
Westman, Claire : "You will at times be using very old sources." : (01:13:43.280)
Westman, Claire : "So when you look up definitions or information," : (01:13:47.370)
Westman, Claire : "you can see if there's more recent ones, but it's also not a huge issue in" : (01:13:50.860)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy if you use older sources." : (01:13:56.313)
Westman, Claire : "OK. Obviously if it's about things that are" : (01:13:59.170)
Westman, Claire : "this is about ancient Greek philosophy." : (01:14:01.630)
Westman, Claire : "So you you would still look for more recent information because new ideas come" : (01:14:03.810)
Westman, Claire : "along and new interpretations, but it's not." : (01:14:09.188)
Westman, Claire : "100% necessary to use newer sources." : (01:14:13.210)
Westman, Claire : "So you can use older sources as well." : (01:14:16.240)
Westman, Claire : "If you're doing something like about AI ethics," : (01:14:20.370)
Westman, Claire : "you obviously want to look at new sources, because AI is changing all of the time." : (01:14:23.390)
Westman, Claire : "But when looking at things like ancient Greek philosophy," : (01:14:28.650)
Westman, Claire : "if you're looking for definitions of metaphysics," : (01:14:32.155)
Westman, Claire : "you might find sources that are from sort of 2000, 2005, whatever. That's fine." : (01:14:35.176)
Westman, Claire : "That's not an issue in philosophy, OK?" : (01:14:40.010)
Westman, Claire : "There isn't much information about Salis compared to an ex Amanda and Anis." : (01:14:47.250)
Westman, Claire : "That's quite interesting 'cause. I actually found quite a lot about daleys." : (01:14:54.450)
Westman, Claire : "So again though, remember, you don't have to go into a whole lot of" : (01:14:58.810)
Westman, Claire : "detail." : (01:15:03.344)
Westman, Claire : "It's only 300 words, so just make sure that you have the main" : (01:15:03.810)
Westman, Claire : "focus that ties into this question." : (01:15:08.285)
Westman, Claire : "So when you research these." : (01:15:10.930)
Westman, Claire : "Malesions, you'll see." : (01:15:13.170)
Westman, Claire : "There's a lot of information about other kinds of." : (01:15:13.810)
Westman, Claire : "Philosophical inquiry that they did other things that they looked at related to," : (01:15:16.880)
Westman, Claire : "for example." : (01:15:22.559)
Westman, Claire : "I think there's an ex. Amanda talks about the sun and the moon" : (01:15:25.010)
Westman, Claire : "as disks of fire." : (01:15:29.294)
Westman, Claire : "So some of that is not necessarily relevant to this discussion or to your" : (01:15:32.290)
Westman, Claire : "answer. So remember to focus on for now what is" : (01:15:36.969)
Westman, Claire : "most important to helping you answer this question about how the MALESIONS could be" : (01:15:40.003)
Westman, Claire : "considered to have been doing." : (01:15:45.314)
Westman, Claire : "Metaphysics." : (01:15:48.560)
Westman, Claire : "So just try and find information that's most relevant for this purpose, OK." : (01:15:51.730)
Westman, Claire : "It's great that you're doing research and that you're seeing you're finding" : (01:15:57.130)
Westman, Claire : "information fantastic." : (01:16:01.783)
Westman, Claire : "But remember, when you're writing up your answers to" : (01:16:04.850)
Westman, Claire : "make sure that that's what you focus on." : (01:16:07.130)
Westman, Claire : "Anyone have an idea how?" : (01:16:14.260)
Westman, Claire : "Especially the bibliography and our study guide." : (01:16:15.380)
Westman, Claire : "The bibliography is there as a bibliography for the information that's" : (01:16:17.300)
Westman, Claire : "included in the study guide and also for you to." : (01:16:21.922)
Westman, Claire : "You can go look use those references to look up." : (01:16:25.111)
Westman, Claire : "But you don't need to reference the bibliography from the study guide in your" : (01:16:32.170)
Westman, Claire : "work, unless you've used one of those sources." : (01:16:37.786)
Westman, Claire : "So if you're using the study guide as your source," : (01:16:41.170)
Westman, Claire : "you reference the study guide. OK, so I hope that answers your question." : (01:16:44.230)
Westman, Claire : "The only time you would need to worry about the references in the bibliography" : (01:16:48.690)
Westman, Claire : "is if you used any of those sources that you had found in the bibliography." : (01:16:53.196)
Westman, Claire : "I won't get into technical referencing now," : (01:17:00.880)
Westman, Claire : "so just focus on if you've used the study guide, reference the study guide." : (01:17:02.875)
Westman, Claire : "That's all we want to see." : (01:17:06.320)
Westman, Claire : "Oh yeah, that's another very good point, guys." : (01:17:12.290)
Westman, Claire : "I'm ladies and gentlemen and everybody." : (01:17:15.170)
Westman, Claire : "I'm so excited to see how the excellent thoughts that are coming up in this" : (01:17:20.330)
Westman, Claire : "discussion or in the chat section and the thoughts that you've been putting into" : (01:17:25.527)
Westman, Claire : "these topics, very, very exciting for me and." : (01:17:31.065)
Westman, Claire : "Yeah, wonderful to see." : (01:17:36.050)
Westman, Claire : "So thank you for you know the thoughts that you've contributed and the ideas" : (01:17:37.290)
Westman, Claire : "that you are coming out of here." : (01:17:41.049)
Westman, Claire : "It's quite hypocrit." : (01:17:43.870)
Westman, Claire : "This is the chat. It says favourites." : (01:17:44.710)
Westman, Claire : "It's quite hypocritical because the reason why we now rely on Western" : (01:17:47.310)
Westman, Claire : "philosophy is because Westerners thought Africans were incapable of reasoning in a" : (01:17:50.802)
Westman, Claire : "critical way." : (01:17:54.942)
Westman, Claire : "Meanwhile, their ancestors believed in myths and" : (01:17:55.630)
Westman, Claire : "Folklore's, just like early Africans did." : (01:17:58.070)
Westman, Claire : "Absolutely, 100%." : (01:18:00.230)
Westman, Claire : "So it is hypocritical and I mean just continue to believe in myth and" : (01:18:05.210)
Westman, Claire : "superstition and all of that." : (01:18:11.150)
Westman, Claire : "Just a very, very, very good point." : (01:18:16.040)
Westman, Claire : "But I'm very impressed by the ideas that I'm seeing come out in this chat." : (01:18:19.440)
Westman, Claire : "So simple, Kazi says." : (01:18:25.640)
Westman, Claire : "Did they contribute to the early discovery of science," : (01:18:27.640)
Westman, Claire : "Thais and the others?" : (01:18:30.680)
Westman, Claire : "So yes, so meta physicians did contribute." : (01:18:32.320)
Westman, Claire : "And sorry, Tabili replied and said yes. Meta physicians were pioneers of the" : (01:18:37.090)
Westman, Claire : "scientific method." : (01:18:41.597)
Westman, Claire : "They sought to understand the fundamental nature of reality through reason," : (01:18:42.650)
Westman, Claire : "observation and systematic inquiry." : (01:18:46.375)
Westman, Claire : "Excellent, great response." : (01:18:48.130)
Westman, Claire : "Yes. So the the purpose of the discussion, these are to help you to approach this" : (01:18:56.620)
Westman, Claire : "assignment." : (01:19:02.193)
Westman, Claire : "Specifically, this is some of the content you should" : (01:19:02.940)
Westman, Claire : "sort of be considering when you're doing your assignment," : (01:19:06.323)
Westman, Claire : "but obviously there to help you understand the units as well." : (01:19:10.024)
Westman, Claire : "But more specifically for today, like I mentioned at the outset," : (01:19:15.450)
Westman, Claire : "the focus is on helping you with the assignment questions." : (01:19:18.931)
Westman, Claire : "Um." : (01:19:23.930)
Westman, Claire : "Tabela that is an excellent question." : (01:19:32.710)
Westman, Claire : "What role did ancient knowledge systems and esoteric traditions," : (01:19:35.230)
Westman, Claire : "including secret societies, play in shaping the emergence of profound" : (01:19:39.222)
Westman, Claire : "metaphysical philosophical inquiry?" : (01:19:43.521)
Westman, Claire : "In particular, how did figures such as Pythagoras who" : (01:19:45.750)
Westman, Claire : "made significant contributions to philosophy and science while also being" : (01:19:48.367)
Westman, Claire : "deeply engaged in mysticism, influenced the development of" : (01:19:51.953)
Westman, Claire : "intellectual thought during this period?" : (01:19:54.812)
Westman, Claire : "That's an excellent question." : (01:19:57.450)
Westman, Claire : "And I think one that we won't get into today because of time," : (01:19:59.120)
Westman, Claire : "but next week we'll focus on question three of the assessment." : (01:20:03.312)
Westman, Claire : "But in the following weeks, we'll look at Unit 1 in more detail." : (01:20:07.572)
Westman, Claire : "And I think that is something we can go into in more detail." : (01:20:11.966)
Westman, Claire : "Then OK." : (01:20:16.320)
Westman, Claire : "I don't want to go too far off the topic just because the focus is for the" : (01:20:17.320)
Westman, Claire : "assessment, but that is a fantastic question that we" : (01:20:21.546)
Westman, Claire : "will look at more deeply in another." : (01:20:24.532)
Westman, Claire : "Session." : (01:20:27.610)
Westman, Claire : "So thank you for that." : (01:20:28.860)
Westman, Claire : "I will make a note of it so that we can discuss it in another session and it'll" : (01:20:31.000)
Westman, Claire : "be interesting to hear what you think as well." : (01:20:35.011)
Westman, Claire : "So everybody can sort of think about that question when they are finished their" : (01:20:37.367)
Westman, Claire : "assignments and less stressed." : (01:20:41.377)
Westman, Claire : "If I use a reference website for my bibliography be highlighted." : (01:20:47.580)
Westman, Claire : "Since I use the website now, that's fine to be honest." : (01:20:52.759)
Westman, Claire : "The bibliography is not always necessarily included." : (01:20:58.640)
Westman, Claire : "When we check plagiarism, because so often the references come up" : (01:21:02.000)
Westman, Claire : "as plagiarized, no matter whether you talk them into the" : (01:21:06.185)
Westman, Claire : "document yourself or not, and the bibliography because they've been" : (01:21:09.798)
Westman, Claire : "referenced elsewhere." : (01:21:14.109)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:21:15.990)
Westman, Claire : "So if you want to use a referencing tool that is absolutely fine." : (01:21:16.190)
Westman, Claire : "Just make sure that you're referencing." : (01:21:21.400)
Westman, Claire : "Is it's all consistent." : (01:21:23.240)
Westman, Claire : "Your if you, if you know how to use the referencing" : (01:21:27.440)
Westman, Claire : "tools, you are absolutely welcome to use them." : (01:21:30.004)
Westman, Claire : "Just remember we use Harvard, but yeah, you're absolutely welcome to use a" : (01:21:32.320)
Westman, Claire : "referencing tool if that is what you want to do." : (01:21:37.111)
Westman, Claire : "No issue with that at all." : (01:21:40.280)
Westman, Claire : "OK, there was." : (01:21:42.650)
Westman, Claire : "I see two hands, but I think 1 is." : (01:21:46.160)
Westman, Claire : "A legacy. Luanda is yours, just up from earlier." : (01:21:49.680)
Westman, Claire : "Or do you have another question?" : (01:21:52.100)
Westman, Claire : "OK, another hand has suddenly gone down." : (01:21:53.760)
Westman, Claire : "So I assume that was an accidental hand." : (01:21:56.360)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:22:02.270)
Westman, Claire : "So here are do you have any questions? OK. I don't want to take much more of your" : (01:22:03.990)
Westman, Claire : "time and I do have another class, Nana." : (01:22:10.334)
Westman, Claire : "So are there anything?" : (01:22:13.350)
Westman, Claire : "Are there any questions that are absolutely pressing right now?" : (01:22:15.750)
Westman, Claire : "Just while you're thinking about it, one thing I want to mention is we've been" : (01:22:22.760)
Westman, Claire : "getting some emails asking how many points of information need to be included" : (01:22:28.278)
Westman, Claire : "in your answer for the 15 marks." : (01:22:33.726)
Westman, Claire : "Remember, we're not looking for." : (01:22:36.720)
Westman, Claire : "You don't have to list 15 points in order to get 15 marks." : (01:22:38.920)
Westman, Claire : "What we're looking for is, have you explained the theory?" : (01:22:42.680)
Westman, Claire : "Accurately and clearly." : (01:22:47.720)
Westman, Claire : "Let's say for question one, have you developed a claim that you've" : (01:22:52.310)
Westman, Claire : "been developed an argument to support?" : (01:22:57.007)
Westman, Claire : "So have you said yes? No." : (01:22:59.670)
Westman, Claire : "Balanced view, whatever and have you supported that" : (01:23:03.800)
Westman, Claire : "argument and have you included your in text referencing in a bibliography?" : (01:23:06.519)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:23:12.320)
Westman, Claire : "So it's very difficult in a subject like this to say you need to include this many" : (01:23:12.480)
Westman, Claire : "points because everybody will answer the question differently." : (01:23:17.597)
Westman, Claire : "Differently, So what we want to see is do have you" : (01:23:21.750)
Westman, Claire : "shown an understanding of the content of the theory?" : (01:23:24.536)
Westman, Claire : "And then have you developed a clear answer?" : (01:23:28.840)
Westman, Claire : "So for example, with the second question, have you made the link between the" : (01:23:31.440)
Westman, Claire : "definitions or understandings of metaphysics and the lesions?" : (01:23:36.980)
Westman, Claire : "Has that come across clearly?" : (01:23:41.440)
Westman, Claire : "So have you explained what metaphysics is?" : (01:23:42.960)
Westman, Claire : "Have you explained what the malesions were?" : (01:23:44.920)
Westman, Claire : "What kind of philosophical inquiry? They were engaged in?" : (01:23:47.400)
Westman, Claire : "And have you then made that link between them?" : (01:23:50.590)
Westman, Claire : "And then for the last question is about Plato's theory of forms and virtue." : (01:23:55.360)
Westman, Claire : "So again, we'll want to see." : (01:24:03.760)
Westman, Claire : "Have you explained the theory clearly?" : (01:24:04.960)
Westman, Claire : "Have you developed a claim?" : (01:24:08.160)
Westman, Claire : "Have you included your referencing?" : (01:24:09.920)
Westman, Claire : "Is it clear?" : (01:24:12.200)
Westman, Claire : "Have you shown an understanding?" : (01:24:13.240)
Westman, Claire : "So that's what we'll be looking for." : (01:24:14.680)
Westman, Claire : "OK. And we know at the stage that you know" : (01:24:16.670)
Westman, Claire : "you're you're new to referencing probably." : (01:24:19.402)
Westman, Claire : "So do your best with the referencing." : (01:24:23.560)
Westman, Claire : "We will be lenient if it's not exactly right." : (01:24:25.200)
Westman, Claire : "If we see you've made an effort with the referencing," : (01:24:27.934)
Westman, Claire : "that's what we're concerned about, OK?" : (01:24:31.142)
Westman, Claire : "Leander is it a hand for now or is it a hand from earlier?" : (01:24:35.840)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "Zahan from now." : (01:24:41.370)
Westman, Claire : "Oh yes." : (01:24:42.990)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "So your question might be a little pessimistic," : (01:24:44.480)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "but given that we've taken philosophy now in the first semester," : (01:24:47.216)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "can we then discontinue from second semester or is this a module that we have" : (01:24:50.920)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "to take throughout the year?" : (01:24:55.365)
Westman, Claire : "This is only SMS to module." : (01:24:57.610)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "OK." : (01:25:00.090)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "Thank you." : (01:25:00.490)
Westman, Claire : "I know." : (01:25:00.990)
Westman, Claire : "I'm already losing people." : (01:25:04.470)
Westman, Claire : "Yeah, this is a simista module." : (01:25:07.910)
Westman, Claire : "Give it a chance." : (01:25:11.560)
Westman, Claire : "I've had somebody else as the e-mail about how to change modules." : (01:25:14.400)
Westman, Claire : "But I know philosophy can be tricky. When you first start. I really do." : (01:25:21.520)
Westman, Claire : "But give it a go." : (01:25:26.760)
Westman, Claire : "Give it a chance." : (01:25:27.560)
Westman, Claire : "Let's see how the semester goes." : (01:25:27.880)
Westman, Claire : "And remember this very there's different kinds of philosophies." : (01:25:30.280)
Westman, Claire : "So you can also do this a module in African philosophy." : (01:25:33.544)
Westman, Claire : "In first year, as you go on these different modules so" : (01:25:37.310)
Westman, Claire : "yeah, but this is mixed to module so you don't" : (01:25:41.213)
Westman, Claire : "have to do do it next year next OK." : (01:25:44.547)
Westman, Claire : "So these are some sources that are quite useful." : (01:25:47.030)
Westman, Claire : "And the Stanford Encyclopedia philosophy is always useful, but it can be." : (01:25:51.150)
Westman, Claire : "Sometimes the articles are quite complex, but it's a good source." : (01:25:56.830)
Westman, Claire : "The incident encyclopedia philosophy, also a very good source." : (01:26:01.760)
Westman, Claire : "For this." : (01:26:06.280)
Westman, Claire : "I also used Britannica." : (01:26:07.510)
Westman, Claire : "And the for information about failures and an ex. Amanda." : (01:26:10.800)
Westman, Claire : "The site was really nice. Famous scientist." : (01:26:15.395)
Westman, Claire : "It broke down a lot of the work that they did. The studies they did," : (01:26:18.880)
Westman, Claire : "and then some videos." : (01:26:23.910)
Westman, Claire : "This crash course." : (01:26:27.080)
Westman, Claire : "This was crash course history of science, but the crash course philosophy do some" : (01:26:28.160)
Westman, Claire : "very nice videos that help to breakdown complex philosophical concepts." : (01:26:32.654)
Westman, Claire : "So go look for the that Channel." : (01:26:36.950)
Westman, Claire : "This also was an A nice video, metaphysics and philosophy explained." : (01:26:42.280)
Westman, Claire : "Here was another one pre socratics part one." : (01:26:46.400)
Westman, Claire : "Sorry I didn't write down the IT was doctor, somebody, explains. Dr." : (01:26:49.600)
Westman, Claire : "Dave explains something like that." : (01:26:54.611)
Westman, Claire : "But yeah, so use whatever resources you have" : (01:26:59.870)
Westman, Claire : "available to you." : (01:27:02.628)
Westman, Claire : "Like I said, you know, go read Wikipedia. Go look at YouTube videos," : (01:27:03.670)
Westman, Claire : "use websites that make things less complex because philosophy is complex," : (01:27:09.550)
Westman, Claire : "it is challenging." : (01:27:15.857)
Westman, Claire : "And a lot of ideas that you've probably never sort of encountered before in ways" : (01:27:18.880)
Westman, Claire : "of thinking that you might not have, you know, sort of engaged with before." : (01:27:23.152)
Westman, Claire : "So don't be hard on yourself either. If you're not understanding it straight" : (01:27:27.160)
Westman, Claire : "away." : (01:27:31.029)
Westman, Claire : "Please do not." : (01:27:32.310)
Westman, Claire : "I think that is going to be the general experiences most people are going to be" : (01:27:33.430)
Westman, Claire : "struggling to understand this. So the first time they read it," : (01:27:38.240)
Westman, Claire : "so give yourself a chance." : (01:27:42.027)
Westman, Claire : "Don't be hard on yourself." : (01:27:43.630)

 <br>Westman, Claire : "Yes, I see." : (00:00:04.249)
Westman, Claire : "Somebody asked if they can use AI to spell check, but to check your grammar." : (00:00:05.249)
Westman, Claire : "But you shouldn't really need to use AI to check your grammar." : (00:00:13.279)
Westman, Claire : "You can use Grammarly so I'm not sure if you have any of you have heard of" : (00:00:17.719)
Westman, Claire : "Grammarly. I'm sure you have." : (00:00:23.315)
Westman, Claire : "I've put it there in the chat." : (00:00:25.479)
Westman, Claire : "That is a very useful tool to help you, you can." : (00:00:28.169)
Westman, Claire : "Load it onto your computer." : (00:00:33.889)
Westman, Claire : "Or can even be part of your browser and it can help you to check your spelling" : (00:00:37.769)
Westman, Claire : "and your grammar." : (00:00:41.916)
Westman, Claire : "Again, just to be very careful of AI, I'm not going to go over that again." : (00:00:43.639)
Westman, Claire : "We discussed it last time." : (00:00:48.799)
Westman, Claire : "So if you are not sure about that, just go back and listen to the lesson" : (00:00:52.369)
Westman, Claire : "from last week." : (00:00:57.047)
Westman, Claire : "I don't want to go over things that we've gone over before because I know that you" : (00:00:58.009)
Westman, Claire : "need to actually be working on the assignments so you don't want to be" : (00:01:02.523)
Westman, Claire : "sitting here hearing things you've heard before." : (00:01:06.384)
Westman, Claire : "Again, I'm just going to say please read the" : (00:01:09.169)
Westman, Claire : "announcements." : (00:01:12.464)
Westman, Claire : "Please read the instructions." : (00:01:14.079)
Westman, Claire : "I'm still getting questions about introductions, conclusions, cover pages," : (00:01:15.759)
Westman, Claire : "contents pages, how to reference the study guide." : (00:01:21.911)
Westman, Claire : "I've put all this information in the announcements." : (00:01:26.013)
Westman, Claire : "It's in the instructions, so all of these questions that I'm" : (00:01:30.279)
Westman, Claire : "getting over and over and over and over the information is there for you and it's" : (00:01:34.754)
Westman, Claire : "making me a bit concerned." : (00:01:40.771)
Westman, Claire : "That you're not actually reading through the information that is provided for you," : (00:01:43.369)
Westman, Claire : "so please make sure you're doing that so before you are," : (00:01:48.553)
Westman, Claire : "I'm very happy to answer questions like I've said before, very," : (00:01:52.114)
Westman, Claire : "very happy to help you where you need help. But before you ask a quest." : (00:01:56.111)
Westman, Claire : "Go look through the materials on the site." : (00:02:01.369)
Westman, Claire : "Look at the instructions of the assignment and make sure that those" : (00:02:06.809)
Westman, Claire : "questions aren't already answered for you." : (00:02:10.122)
Westman, Claire : "Because it takes a lot of time for me to reply to 100 people asking if you need a" : (00:02:12.559)
Westman, Claire : "contents page when there is an announcement about a contents page or" : (00:02:17.815)
Westman, Claire : "asking if there should be an introduction and conclusion when it is very clearly" : (00:02:22.238)
Westman, Claire : "stated in the inst." : (00:02:27.431)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:02:29.359)
Westman, Claire : "So again, don't be afraid to ask me anything." : (00:02:29.559)
Westman, Claire : "But always just try and see if that information is already out there." : (00:02:35.409)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:02:44.969)
Westman, Claire : "So I see again some mixed reactions about the assignment." : (00:02:46.969)
Westman, Claire : "Some people said it's going OK." : (00:02:51.089)
Westman, Claire : "Some people saying it seems to think it seems to be fine here." : (00:02:56.249)
Nthabiseng Vinoliah  Rammole : "But I." : (00:02:56.889)
Westman, Claire : "A bit stressful, especially the word count." : (00:02:59.609)
Westman, Claire : "I know 300 words is not a lot." : (00:03:02.529)
Westman, Claire : "But just try to stick to it as much as possible." : (00:03:06.569)
Westman, Claire : "I know it says say that if you're over the word count." : (00:03:12.289)
Westman, Claire : "It might not be marked." : (00:03:14.799)
Westman, Claire : "We definitely will mark it. Don't worry, you're not going to get zero for going" : (00:03:15.879)
Westman, Claire : "over the word count." : (00:03:19.815)
Westman, Claire : "But we might reduce some of the marks." : (00:03:22.289)
Westman, Claire : "If you have gone way over the word count, OK, and you know," : (00:03:27.239)
Ntsako Nkuna : "Hey." : (00:03:31.319)
Westman, Claire : "sometimes we see things like it'll say, for example," : (00:03:31.605)
Ntsako Nkuna : "Aye." : (00:03:35.369)
Westman, Claire : "if for your next assignment where it's 1000 word, essay or whatever it is." : (00:03:35.461)
Nthabiseng Vinoliah  Rammole : "Play." : (00:03:41.539)
Ntsako Nkuna : "Yes." : (00:03:41.739)
Westman, Claire : "Some people will submit 10 pages." : (00:03:42.449)
Westman, Claire : "And very often it's because they've submitted." : (00:03:45.929)
Westman, Claire : "An entirely plagiarized article or something like that." : (00:03:49.449)
Westman, Claire : "But if you go way over the word count." : (00:03:53.289)
Westman, Claire : "I know it's difficult when you're excited about it, but you're enjoying it," : (00:03:57.439)
Westman, Claire : "thinking about the topic, or you have a lot of ideas." : (00:04:02.583)
Nthabiseng Vinoliah  Rammole : "Bye bye." : (00:04:07.339)
Westman, Claire : "It can be difficult to stick to the word count and let me tell you I am a person" : (00:04:07.729)
Westman, Claire : "who writes a lot." : (00:04:13.217)
Westman, Claire : "I'm a very wordy person." : (00:04:14.369)
Westman, Claire : "You might have even noticed when I'm talking I, especially in my writing," : (00:04:16.569)
Westman, Claire : "that I'm I used a lot of words." : (00:04:21.728)
Westman, Claire : "So." : (00:04:25.769)
Westman, Claire : "I understand how difficult it is to have to condense your writing." : (00:04:26.999)
Westman, Claire : "It's something that I still have to work on even after being in academics for." : (00:04:31.919)
Nthabiseng Vinoliah  Rammole : "Setting." : (00:04:32.499)
Westman, Claire : "Many, many, many years." : (00:04:38.209)
Westman, Claire : "So it will take time for you to get used to that as well." : (00:04:41.559)
Westman, Claire : "I see somebody said 303 words." : (00:04:46.172)
Westman, Claire : "Oh, I wonder why it's echoing." : (00:04:50.049)
Westman, Claire : "Yeah. Does anyone have their marks on?" : (00:04:56.619)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:05:03.089)
Westman, Claire : "I've muted everybody." : (00:05:03.689)
Westman, Claire : "Can you hear me now?" : (00:05:04.729)
Westman, Claire : "OK. Am I OK now?" : (00:05:11.419)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:05:14.129)
Westman, Claire : "So somebody must have had the mark on." : (00:05:14.769)
Westman, Claire : "So yeah, just please make sure that you turn your" : (00:05:17.329)
Westman, Claire : "marks off." : (00:05:19.662)
Westman, Claire : "I've muted everybody for now." : (00:05:20.129)
Westman, Claire : "It's just difficult for me to keep an eye on the chat," : (00:05:23.449)
Westman, Claire : "on the microphones and all of that." : (00:05:26.455)
Westman, Claire : "So everybody, please just be careful of that." : (00:05:28.369)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:05:33.049)
Westman, Claire : "So yeah, I was saying I rights a lot." : (00:05:33.329)
Westman, Claire : "So it's I know how difficult it is to try and condense your writing." : (00:05:35.049)
Westman, Claire : "And then I see somebody said 303 words." : (00:05:40.609)
Westman, Claire : "Steps absolutely perfect." : (00:05:43.159)
Westman, Claire : "I promise you were not gonna be counting an extra 3 words and penalizing you for" : (00:05:46.079)
Westman, Claire : "that. 367 is also still OK." : (00:05:52.439)
Westman, Claire : "You know again." : (00:05:56.289)
Westman, Claire : "300 words is so usually when you get a word count you need to be within the area" : (00:05:59.529)
Westman, Claire : "of that word count." : (00:06:06.138)
Westman, Claire : "So you can't submit something that's 200 words and you can't submit something." : (00:06:07.969)
Westman, Claire : "That's 400 words, because that's much." : (00:06:11.939)
Westman, Claire : "Too little and too much if it's around sort of three 5360 ISH 367 is fine." : (00:06:14.239)
Westman, Claire : "You know you're OK again." : (00:06:26.039)
Westman, Claire : "Also, if you're like 200 and 72180 words, you're OK if the word count is 300," : (00:06:28.399)
Westman, Claire : "so we don't expect you to sit there and work out exactly 300 words." : (00:06:34.639)
Westman, Claire : "That is." : (00:06:40.969)
Westman, Claire : "That is the range you need." : (00:06:43.169)
Westman, Claire : "Need to be in OK." : (00:06:44.359)
Westman, Claire : "656 years." : (00:06:48.489)
Westman, Claire : "That's way over." : (00:06:50.289)
Westman, Claire : "Lassander, the university policy is 21 working days" : (00:06:54.729)
Westman, Claire : "for your marks." : (00:07:00.410)
Westman, Claire : "So that is what we aim to work on. Remember for this module there are four" : (00:07:02.289)
Westman, Claire : "of us who do marking. So some marking might be done." : (00:07:08.804)
Westman, Claire : "A bit quicker, so I might you know some some of us might" : (00:07:13.959)
Westman, Claire : "get on a bit more quickly than other people depending on what our marking load" : (00:07:17.530)
Westman, Claire : "is at the time because you are not out, you know this is not our only module for" : (00:07:22.479)
Westman, Claire : "all of us we." : (00:07:27.554)
Westman, Claire : "All have other modules as well, so we work." : (00:07:28.369)
Westman, Claire : "We try our work on 21 working days to get your marks back to you. So if." : (00:07:31.990)
Westman, Claire : "You don't get your marks after three weeks." : (00:07:38.889)
Westman, Claire : "Then let us know." : (00:07:42.889)
Westman, Claire : "That you haven't received them. If it's within three weeks." : (00:07:44.239)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:07:49.779)
Westman, Claire : "I just said that some of, but I think you might have been typing" : (00:07:50.939)
Westman, Claire : "that while I was talking." : (00:07:53.654)
Westman, Claire : "Some might get your marks a bit earlier than others." : (00:07:54.699)
Westman, Claire : "So what I'm saying is, if you haven't got your marks after three" : (00:07:57.219)
Westman, Claire : "weeks, then let me know if your friend has got" : (00:08:01.050)
Westman, Claire : "their Marks and you haven't got yours, then don't panic." : (00:08:03.821)
Westman, Claire : "If it's within that time frame, you might have just had a different" : (00:08:07.181)
Westman, Claire : "marker or." : (00:08:11.189)
Westman, Claire : "Mark, Mark this week and then mark some next" : (00:08:13.249)
Westman, Claire : "week, whatever it is, OK, so." : (00:08:15.730)
Westman, Claire : "Please don't panic." : (00:08:18.929)
Westman, Claire : "And we will only start marking from next week. Even though you submit tomorrow." : (00:08:19.919)
Westman, Claire : "But then there's a process where I have to allocate marking to markers so that" : (00:08:27.119)
Westman, Claire : "takes a little bit of time as well." : (00:08:32.496)
Westman, Claire : "OK, so I think let's get into the important" : (00:08:36.489)
Westman, Claire : "stuff for today. Obviously, if you have questions as we go along," : (00:08:39.477)
Westman, Claire : "please post them in the chat." : (00:08:43.959)
Westman, Claire : "I see some of you are assisting me. Thank you very much." : (00:08:46.769)
Westman, Claire : "About answering your your peers in the module and also thank you on the WhatsApp" : (00:08:49.999)
Westman, Claire : "group, there was a lot of chat last night, so I've not gone through all of that." : (00:08:54.779)
Westman, Claire : "But thank you to all of you who are engaging on the WhatsApp group and" : (00:09:01.959)
Westman, Claire : "helping each other." : (00:09:05.777)
Westman, Claire : "It's very encouraging to see you helping the other people in the module and" : (00:09:06.799)
Westman, Claire : "working together and building a little community." : (00:09:11.479)
Westman, Claire : "Of you know, with your peers in the module." : (00:09:15.969)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:09:19.329)
Westman, Claire : "So today we are only looking at question three of the assignment question one and" : (00:09:19.849)
Westman, Claire : "two we covered last week." : (00:09:24.907)
Westman, Claire : "So if you haven't watched last week's session, please go do so." : (00:09:26.449)
Westman, Claire : "I saw, I think on the WhatsApp that somebody" : (00:09:30.439)
Westman, Claire : "said they weren't quite sure how to answer question one," : (00:09:33.421)
Westman, Claire : "and I'm perhaps that's because they didn't watch last week's recording yet or" : (00:09:37.199)
Westman, Claire : "didn't attend last week." : (00:09:42.368)
Westman, Claire : "So if you are, if you haven't watched last week's" : (00:09:44.079)
Westman, Claire : "recording, please go do so." : (00:09:47.585)
Westman, Claire : "And then today we're just going to look at question 3OK." : (00:09:51.009)
Westman, Claire : "So we're going to look at question three and then you can ask any of your" : (00:09:55.409)
Westman, Claire : "questions." : (00:09:59.884)
Westman, Claire : "So Question 3 asks." : (00:10:00.999)
Westman, Claire : "Why did Plato think that virtue depends on knowledge?" : (00:10:05.259)
Westman, Claire : "Do you agree with this view and explain your answer?" : (00:10:09.179)
Westman, Claire : "So remember, like I said last week, whenever you have a question," : (00:10:13.259)
Westman, Claire : "the first thing you want to do is look at what the question is asking you." : (00:10:17.883)
Westman, Claire : "Very carefully." : (00:10:24.639)
Westman, Claire : "So you want to break it down?" : (00:10:25.839)
Westman, Claire : "So here we know we're talking about Plato." : (00:10:26.479)
Westman, Claire : "We're talking about virtue and knowledge." : (00:10:29.239)
Westman, Claire : "And then it goes beyond asking you to simply explain." : (00:10:35.359)
Westman, Claire : "Plato's ideas around knowledge and virtue, and asks you if you agree or disagree" : (00:10:41.799)
Westman, Claire : "with what platea thanks. And in doing so you need to explain your" : (00:10:47.217)
Westman, Claire : "answer so you can't just say yes." : (00:10:51.631)
Westman, Claire : "I agree." : (00:10:53.839)
Westman, Claire : "Or no, I don't agree." : (00:10:54.479)
Westman, Claire : "And leave it at that. You need to explain your answer." : (00:10:55.719)
Westman, Claire : "More fully." : (00:11:00.999)
Westman, Claire : "And so I'm just closing something quickly." : (00:11:02.409)
Westman, Claire : "OK, so always again we spoke about this last" : (00:11:04.489)
Westman, Claire : "week, but always when you start your" : (00:11:07.439)
Westman, Claire : "assignments or even when you get your exams or anything like that," : (00:11:09.865)
Westman, Claire : "the first thing you must always do before you start answering is breakdown the" : (00:11:14.258)
Westman, Claire : "question and try and think about exactly what." : (00:11:19.437)
Westman, Claire : "It is asking you and how it's asking you to do that." : (00:11:22.519)
Westman, Claire : "So instruction words would for example be that it tells you 300 words." : (00:11:25.569)
Westman, Claire : "Is your word count." : (00:11:31.359)
Westman, Claire : "So always look at that." : (00:11:33.909)
Westman, Claire : "Sorry, I see somebody said." : (00:11:36.869)
Westman, Claire : "How did it stop recording? Thank you." : (00:11:41.479)
Westman, Claire : "It says it's recording." : (00:11:45.159)
Westman, Claire : "Is it showing that it's recording on anybody else's?" : (00:11:52.769)
Westman, Claire : "Because I mine is showing the little recording thing." : (00:11:56.889)
Westman, Claire : "OK, alright. Yeah. On my side, it looks like it's recording." : (00:12:00.529)
Westman, Claire : "Ish. Ramu lephie. Do you have a question you can turn on" : (00:12:06.679)
Westman, Claire : "your mic?" : (00:12:09.926)
Westman, Claire : "Esra Molefi a question." : (00:12:19.189)
Westman, Claire : "Your hand is up, OK?" : (00:12:22.069)
Westman, Claire : "All right. OK." : (00:12:23.269)
Westman, Claire : "Thank you for letting me know. In any case, yeah. Obviously," : (00:12:25.149)
Westman, Claire : "if you do notice anything weird, just let me know." : (00:12:28.700)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:12:33.279)
Westman, Claire : "So to answer this question again, it's tricky because it's 300 words and" : (00:12:35.399)
Westman, Claire : "you could write a lot about Plato." : (00:12:41.648)
Westman, Claire : "So you're going to need to focus on the most important information." : (00:12:44.959)
Westman, Claire : "And for that reason, we won't go into a lot of detail." : (00:12:49.029)
Westman, Claire : "About Plato's theory of the forms, we need to touch on it," : (00:12:55.399)
Westman, Claire : "because you need to explain that in order to get to your answer." : (00:12:59.871)
Westman, Claire : "But for today's purposes, we're not going to go into the very" : (00:13:05.399)
Westman, Claire : "intricate information about the his idea of the form we're going to look at it" : (00:13:10.214)
Westman, Claire : "briefly because you only need." : (00:13:16.349)
Westman, Claire : "To you will only be able to discuss the theory of the forms briefly in your" : (00:13:18.829)
Westman, Claire : "answer. OK, so in order to answer this question," : (00:13:24.418)
Westman, Claire : "you're going to need to explain Plato's theory of the forms." : (00:13:28.022)
Westman, Claire : "In order to show why he thinks that the form of the good is the highest of the" : (00:13:34.079)
Westman, Claire : "forms, and in so doing, that will help you to explain why." : (00:13:42.253)
Westman, Claire : "He thinks that virtue depends on knowledge." : (00:13:48.629)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:13:52.589)
Westman, Claire : "So we've got kind of got three things that you need to do before you Give your" : (00:13:52.749)
Westman, Claire : "opinion." : (00:13:58.270)
Westman, Claire : "You need to give a brief idea of what the theory of the forms is." : (00:13:59.189)
Westman, Claire : "Show what?" : (00:14:05.799)
Westman, Claire : "Show why, he says the form of the good is or" : (00:14:06.639)
Westman, Claire : "explain that he thinks that the form of the good is the most important form." : (00:14:09.486)
Westman, Claire : "See, people are not muted again." : (00:14:19.259)
Westman, Claire : "Why he thinks that?" : (00:14:21.819)
Westman, Claire : "The form of the good is the highest of all forms." : (00:14:23.219)
Westman, Claire : "And then how the pursuit of the form of the good?" : (00:14:26.579)
Westman, Claire : "Is related to virtue or how? That depends." : (00:14:32.239)
Westman, Claire : "Virtue depends on working towards that knowledge." : (00:14:35.359)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:14:39.919)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:14:43.159)
Westman, Claire : "All right." : (00:14:43.479)
Westman, Claire : "So there is a lot going on on my screen here." : (00:14:45.239)
Westman, Claire : "Please, if you're not asking about questions" : (00:14:49.519)
Westman, Claire : "about." : (00:14:53.401)
Westman, Claire : "The actual." : (00:14:55.679)
Westman, Claire : "Admin about the actual presentation, can you please just save it because there" : (00:14:58.399)
Westman, Claire : "is a lot going on. I'm having to let people in." : (00:15:02.156)
Westman, Claire : "There's a lot coming up in the chat." : (00:15:04.439)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:15:08.599)
Westman, Claire : "So if, unless it's important, please don't post it in the chat." : (00:15:08.759)
Westman, Claire : "OK, so I will say this again." : (00:15:12.389)
Westman, Claire : "There are three things you need to focus on." : (00:15:14.989)
Westman, Claire : "In order to give an overview of Plato's theory," : (00:15:21.819)
Westman, Claire : "you need to 1st we get to that now." : (00:15:25.751)
Westman, Claire : "Don't look at that yet." : (00:15:28.619)
Westman, Claire : "Otherwise you'll get distracted." : (00:15:29.419)
Westman, Claire : "You need to give a brief overview of Plato's idea of the forms." : (00:15:31.379)
Westman, Claire : "Then you will need to explain." : (00:15:40.229)
Westman, Claire : "Why? Or you will need to explain that Plato" : (00:15:44.879)
Westman, Claire : "thinks the form of the good is the highest form." : (00:15:48.626)
Westman, Claire : "And then you will need to show how this relates to virtue." : (00:15:54.559)
Westman, Claire : "So you will need to show that the pursuit of knowledge." : (00:16:01.199)
Westman, Claire : "Is dependent." : (00:16:08.509)
Westman, Claire : "Sorry, I'm so distracted by these chats." : (00:16:12.799)
Westman, Claire : "Let me just close it for now." : (00:16:14.479)
Westman, Claire : "You will need to explain." : (00:16:15.639)
Westman, Claire : "That virtue depends on the pursuit of knowledge of the form of the good." : (00:16:18.319)
Westman, Claire : "We're going to look at all of this, OK, when you Give your opinion, yes," : (00:16:24.319)
Westman, Claire : "you need to back up." : (00:16:29.342)
Westman, Claire : "Why you have that opinion, OK?" : (00:16:30.719)
Westman, Claire : "So you need to say why do you agree with this or not?" : (00:16:33.319)
Westman, Claire : "You can think about objections that are raised against." : (00:16:36.479)
Westman, Claire : "Plato's theory." : (00:16:39.709)
Westman, Claire : "If you agree with it, why do you agree with it?" : (00:16:43.919)
Westman, Claire : "Look for some kind of information to back up your opinion." : (00:16:46.399)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:16:54.699)
Westman, Claire : "So let's begin. The world of the forms, according to Plato." : (00:16:55.099)
Westman, Claire : "So let's look at. This is a brief overview of his theory of" : (00:16:59.979)
Westman, Claire : "the forms." : (00:17:04.127)
Westman, Claire : "So according to Plato, so Plato was a realist." : (00:17:04.979)
Westman, Claire : "Plato believed that the world that we experience through our sense perceptions" : (00:17:09.149)
Westman, Claire : "or through our five senses, is not real." : (00:17:14.831)
Westman, Claire : "So we don't have real knowledge." : (00:17:17.709)
Westman, Claire : "Of the world around us and we will look at that a little bit more as we go along" : (00:17:21.279)
Westman, Claire : "through this lesson." : (00:17:26.604)
Westman, Claire : "So he thinks that the things we experience in this world," : (00:17:28.399)
Westman, Claire : "the things we can touch, smells Saints." : (00:17:31.795)
Westman, Claire : "Are not real knowledge of those things." : (00:17:35.839)
Westman, Claire : "So I can be looking at my desk and say, OK," : (00:17:37.989)
Westman, Claire : "I know what a disk is by looking at it and Plato would say that's not true." : (00:17:41.069)
Westman, Claire : "I don't have real knowledge of a desk just by being able to touch the desk," : (00:17:46.589)
Westman, Claire : "smell the desk if I wanted to in front of me." : (00:17:52.320)
Westman, Claire : "So he says that in fact our sensory experiences or our senses can hinder the" : (00:17:55.949)
Westman, Claire : "pursuit of knowledge." : (00:18:02.392)
Westman, Claire : "Of true real things." : (00:18:05.679)
Westman, Claire : "Because they distract us from using rational judgment or reason." : (00:18:07.789)
Westman, Claire : "So he thinks that to really have knowledge of something." : (00:18:13.749)
Westman, Claire : "It cannot change." : (00:18:18.919)
Westman, Claire : "Or be susceptible to decay. So he says that the world around us" : (00:18:22.439)
Westman, Claire : "changes." : (00:18:26.634)
Westman, Claire : "It decays." : (00:18:27.199)
Westman, Claire : "So today we might see a plant and think, OK, that is what a plant is." : (00:18:28.479)
Westman, Claire : "But then tomorrow, maybe that or in a few days time that" : (00:18:34.759)
Westman, Claire : "plant is dead. And so it's changed and it starts to rot" : (00:18:38.565)
Westman, Claire : "away so." : (00:18:42.304)
Westman, Claire : "He will say that we because of that change in the world around us." : (00:18:43.189)
Westman, Claire : "What we perceive, what we experience in the world through" : (00:18:47.789)
Westman, Claire : "our senses and through our perceptions, is not true." : (00:18:52.062)
Westman, Claire : "Knowledge of the things around us. It's not true knowledge." : (00:18:55.968)
Westman, Claire : "So he thinks that to have knowledge of something to have true or real knowledge" : (00:19:01.919)
Westman, Claire : "of something, it needs to be unchanging, absolute and universal." : (00:19:06.641)
Westman, Claire : "So he says that what we know must be true and all of what we know has to be true." : (00:19:14.179)
Westman, Claire : "And it always has to remain true, despite change and deceptive appearances." : (00:19:21.299)
Westman, Claire : "So he associates knowledge with truth." : (00:19:29.359)
Westman, Claire : "So if something is true, then we can know it." : (00:19:33.039)
K KAWUTA : "Hey I I." : (00:19:37.609)
Westman, Claire : "So he says that we can't have knowledge and it can't be true." : (00:19:38.759)
K KAWUTA : "Have a pen?" : (00:19:42.759)
Westman, Claire : "That what we experience is the true real knowledge because of change and because" : (00:19:43.989)
K KAWUTA : "Hello." : (00:19:48.569)
Westman, Claire : "of deceptive appearances, because of the subjectivity." : (00:19:50.230)
Westman, Claire : "Of our experiences, OK." : (00:19:55.839)
Westman, Claire : "So if you think about if." : (00:19:58.039)
Westman, Claire : "I see the color red and you see the color red." : (00:20:02.239)
Westman, Claire : "The color red that we both see is not necessarily the same when we see it." : (00:20:06.204)
Westman, Claire : "OK so." : (00:20:12.532)
Westman, Claire : "So let me give you a different example." : (00:20:13.829)
Westman, Claire : "If I eat a piece of chocolate and think that it's delicious," : (00:20:18.919)
K KAWUTA : "All right." : (00:20:21.129)
Westman, Claire : "you might eat that piece of chocolate from that same slab and you don't like it." : (00:20:22.974)
K KAWUTA : "Yes, Sir." : (00:20:25.099)
Westman, Claire : "So maybe it's dark chocolate and you don't like dark chocolate." : (00:20:28.359)
Westman, Claire : "So some of these things that we consider to be knowledge. So I might say," : (00:20:33.159)
Westman, Claire : "I know that dark chocolate." : (00:20:37.496)
Westman, Claire : "Is delicious." : (00:20:39.469)
K KAWUTA : "I am so sorry. No understand." : (00:20:41.759)
Westman, Claire : "But to you, because of our subjective experiences," : (00:20:41.919)
Westman, Claire : "you would say no, you don't know that dark chocolate is" : (00:20:45.123)
Westman, Claire : "delicious because you don't like dark chocolate." : (00:20:48.640)
Westman, Claire : "OK so." : (00:20:53.519)
Westman, Claire : "So because of the subjectivity, because of different experiences," : (00:20:56.069)
Westman, Claire : "because there's this change and this decay and this deceptive appearances." : (00:21:01.630)
Westman, Claire : "That is why Plato says that the things that we experience are not true knowledge." : (00:21:08.189)
Westman, Claire : "So he argues. Or he argued that there is a world or a" : (00:21:14.959)
Westman, Claire : "realm in which stable, perfect, unchanging." : (00:21:20.733)
Westman, Claire : "Universal objects exist and these." : (00:21:25.709)
Westman, Claire : "Are behind the changing object objects of our scene's experience," : (00:21:33.079)
Westman, Claire : "so we're going to look at that a bit more now." : (00:21:36.233)
Westman, Claire : "So he says that there's this realm that exists beyond the human." : (00:21:38.959)
Westman, Claire : "But he says the recording has stopped again." : (00:21:50.119)
Westman, Claire : "Umm." : (00:21:54.699)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:21:57.159)
Westman, Claire : "I'm not sure." : (00:21:57.559)
Westman, Claire : "Why it says that?" : (00:22:00.439)
Westman, Claire : "Because it's still showing on mine that it's recording." : (00:22:04.079)
Westman, Claire : "I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on today and" : (00:22:10.589)
Westman, Claire : "I'm getting very distracted by the chat again." : (00:22:12.898)
Westman, Claire : "Can you just give me a thumbs up? If you can see it's recording?" : (00:22:16.469)
Westman, Claire : "OK, OK." : (00:22:26.569)
Westman, Claire : "All right." : (00:22:28.929)
Westman, Claire : "Still recording on your side, OK." : (00:22:29.289)
Westman, Claire : "Sorry everyone, I just wanted to stop recording and then" : (00:22:31.049)
Westman, Claire : "people miss out. OK, so." : (00:22:35.186)
Westman, Claire : "He says this this world of experiences is not true knowledge." : (00:22:38.719)
Westman, Claire : "True knowledge exists in this realm that is beyond the human experience and beyond," : (00:22:41.959)
Westman, Claire : "beyond the human mind." : (00:22:48.330)
Westman, Claire : "And this is the world of the forms, or the realm of the forms." : (00:22:49.999)
Westman, Claire : "And in this realm of the forms there are." : (00:22:54.554)
Westman, Claire : "These perfect, unchanging universal objects or things" : (00:22:57.669)
Westman, Claire : "that exist." : (00:23:04.282)
Westman, Claire : "And those what we see in the world are simply." : (00:23:06.789)
Westman, Claire : "Reflections or." : (00:23:13.239)
Westman, Claire : "Instances of those forms OK." : (00:23:17.079)
Westman, Claire : "So this is maybe a bit confusing, but we're going to look at the forms and" : (00:23:20.119)
Westman, Claire : "then we will we'll look at it a bit more." : (00:23:25.058)
Westman, Claire : "So he says that philosophers in particular need to engage in the pursuit" : (00:23:27.959)
Westman, Claire : "of this knowledge." : (00:23:32.355)
Westman, Claire : "He says everybody should work towards." : (00:23:33.439)
Westman, Claire : "Towards attaining knowledge of the forms, however," : (00:23:37.229)
Westman, Claire : "he doesn't believe that everybody can work towards knowledge of the forms" : (00:23:41.493)
Westman, Claire : "because." : (00:23:47.680)
Westman, Claire : "He he doesn't think that everybody is capable of that, OK." : (00:23:50.639)
Westman, Claire : "So he says that not everyone is able to." : (00:23:57.519)
Westman, Claire : "Really engage in the pursuit of knowledge." : (00:24:03.279)
Westman, Claire : "Of real knowledge." : (00:24:06.249)
Westman, Claire : "Because it's some people are distracted by the Saints experiences." : (00:24:08.999)
Westman, Claire : "Some people don't use their reason and their rational mind enough to work" : (00:24:13.639)
Westman, Claire : "towards that pursuit of knowledge." : (00:24:18.764)
Westman, Claire : "Some people are scared of the pursuits of knowledge." : (00:24:21.119)
Westman, Claire : "So he thinks that it's only philosophers or people with philosophical minds that" : (00:24:26.279)
Westman, Claire : "can truly engage in trying to attain knowledge." : (00:24:32.055)
Westman, Claire : "But that we should all work towards it in any case." : (00:24:36.469)
Westman, Claire : "So." : (00:24:41.079)
Westman, Claire : "The." : (00:24:43.029)
Westman, Claire : "Forms." : (00:24:46.719)
Westman, Claire : "So like I said, the forms exist in this realm that Plato" : (00:24:47.949)
Westman, Claire : "believes is independent of our experience and it's independent of our mind." : (00:24:52.920)
Westman, Claire : "So he says the forms have an objective existence." : (00:24:59.549)
Westman, Claire : "So the the forms don't depend on our minds or on our experiences." : (00:25:03.309)
Westman, Claire : "He believes they exist." : (00:25:09.924)
Westman, Claire : "On their own, as separate from our experiences and" : (00:25:13.429)
Westman, Claire : "separate from our mind." : (00:25:17.564)
Westman, Claire : "However." : (00:25:21.269)
Westman, Claire : "They are not ideas or concepts and This is why he says they're separate from" : (00:25:23.759)
Westman, Claire : "almat because if he said if if they were part of our minds," : (00:25:29.400)
Westman, Claire : "then they are ideas or concepts that are developed by our minds." : (00:25:33.796)
Westman, Claire : "But he says they exist independently of the human mind," : (00:25:38.759)
Westman, Claire : "though they don't come from the human mind. They already exist in this realm." : (00:25:42.486)
Westman, Claire : "Beyond the mind." : (00:25:48.879)
Westman, Claire : "Beyond the world we experience beyond." : (00:25:50.429)
Westman, Claire : "Our minds, so they are separate from us as humans." : (00:25:56.479)
Westman, Claire : "They exist." : (00:26:00.799)
Westman, Claire : "They're independently on their own." : (00:26:01.519)
Westman, Claire : "But it is only through the mind and through using rationality and reason," : (00:26:05.599)
Westman, Claire : "that we can pursue knowledge of what is real." : (00:26:11.176)
Westman, Claire : "And this is what Plato is called a realist." : (00:26:14.643)
Westman, Claire : "Because he believed that we had to use reason and rationality and the mind in" : (00:26:18.349)
Westman, Claire : "order to discover what is real." : (00:26:25.419)
Westman, Claire : "You might have seen already that for Plato." : (00:26:28.269)
Westman, Claire : "Sorry for Aristotle. For example he believed in." : (00:26:30.509)
Westman, Claire : "He believed that we learned through our Saints experiences." : (00:26:37.199)
Westman, Claire : "So Aristotle believed that we needed to experience things in order to develop" : (00:26:40.706)
Westman, Claire : "knowledge of them." : (00:26:45.266)
Westman, Claire : "But for Plato." : (00:26:46.399)
Westman, Claire : "Our sense experiences don't give us real knowledge." : (00:26:48.309)
Westman, Claire : "As I've said, it's our mind working in pursuit of" : (00:26:51.149)
Westman, Claire : "knowledge." : (00:26:56.482)
Westman, Claire : "And using reason in order to try and pursue knowledge that we can try and gain" : (00:26:59.189)
Westman, Claire : "real knowledge of the forms that exist independent from us." : (00:27:06.554)
Westman, Claire : "So knowledge can only be accessed through reason." : (00:27:12.349)
Westman, Claire : "So in order to understand that though, we need to understand that for Plato," : (00:27:16.599)
Westman, Claire : "he was a dualist." : (00:27:20.727)
Westman, Claire : "So he believed that there was a soul that was separate from the the body." : (00:27:21.759)
Westman, Claire : "So he believed that humans had a body and a brain, but then," : (00:27:29.199)
Westman, Claire : "separate from that was a soul that exists independently of and is superior to the" : (00:27:34.902)
Westman, Claire : "material body." : (00:27:42.570)
Westman, Claire : "Oh, I see." : (00:27:43.879)
Westman, Claire : "I made a." : (00:27:44.319)
Westman, Claire : "Sorry, I see I made a little tarpa there." : (00:27:47.439)
Westman, Claire : "Superior to material, the body I wrote." : (00:27:50.479)
Westman, Claire : "I'll fix it." : (00:27:52.879)
Westman, Claire : "The soul is independent of and superior to the material body." : (00:27:54.119)
Westman, Claire : "So he and some of you might have this belief as well." : (00:27:58.429)
Westman, Claire : "I mean, this is quite a a common belief that" : (00:28:02.989)
Westman, Claire : "people believe that you have a soul, that that lives on after." : (00:28:05.939)
Westman, Claire : "Your material body dies, for example." : (00:28:11.599)
Westman, Claire : "So that's kind of the idea that Plato had that we had this body that could" : (00:28:15.079)
Westman, Claire : "experience things, but then beyond that we had a soul." : (00:28:19.279)
Westman, Claire : "And he thought that the soul belongs to the world or the realm of the forms." : (00:28:23.229)
Westman, Claire : "So he said that sometimes when we might die and our soul might return to the" : (00:28:28.189)
Westman, Claire : "world of the forms." : (00:28:34.124)
Westman, Claire : "And that's why when." : (00:28:35.829)
Westman, Claire : "We are born and as we go through our lives," : (00:28:40.239)
Westman, Claire : "we are able to work towards knowledge of the forms," : (00:28:43.220)
Westman, Claire : "because our soul already has some knowledge," : (00:28:46.742)
Westman, Claire : "some understanding of the forms." : (00:28:49.791)
Westman, Claire : "So it recollects." : (00:28:52.389)
Westman, Claire : "So he's got the idea of recollection." : (00:28:54.029)
Westman, Claire : "The soul has already this kind of knowledge, some knowledge of the forms." : (00:28:58.599)
Westman, Claire : "And that is how we can have an idea that the forms exist and how we can work" : (00:29:06.239)
Westman, Claire : "towards the knowledge of the forms." : (00:29:12.069)
Westman, Claire : "But he says that when our soul comes back from the world of the forms that" : (00:29:15.239)
Westman, Claire : "corrupted by our senses." : (00:29:20.966)
Westman, Claire : "Experiences. So it forgets what the forms are exactly." : (00:29:23.149)
Westman, Claire : "So it doesn't have full knowledge of the form of full recollection of the forms." : (00:29:28.869)
Westman, Claire : "It has an imperfect or a diminished recollection of the forms," : (00:29:35.109)
Westman, Claire : "and that's why then we have to work towards attaining the knowledge of the" : (00:29:40.266)
Westman, Claire : "forms again." : (00:29:46.406)
Westman, Claire : "But he says again that this is only possible because we have a soul." : (00:29:48.199)
Westman, Claire : "That is independent of our material bodies and he believes that the soul is" : (00:29:53.829)
Westman, Claire : "superior to the material body. He places more emphasis on the importance" : (00:29:59.464)
Westman, Claire : "of the soul and the mind. As you can see, than he does on a physical world and a" : (00:30:04.877)
Westman, Claire : "physical bodies." : (00:30:10.882)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:30:13.559)
Westman, Claire : "So the forms are these objects, these things that exist independently in" : (00:30:14.469)
Westman, Claire : "the realm of the world of the forms." : (00:30:20.791)
Westman, Claire : "And they are universal. So." : (00:30:24.829)
Westman, Claire : "He says that they have." : (00:30:29.279)
Westman, Claire : "They are a general term that applies to a property that is common to many objects." : (00:30:30.879)
Westman, Claire : "So I'll give you an example now." : (00:30:36.799)
Westman, Claire : "So in order to know what something is like," : (00:30:40.189)
Westman, Claire : "we further we need to have knowledge of the universals that are independent of" : (00:30:43.454)
Westman, Claire : "all prior to our sense perceptions of that thing." : (00:30:49.318)
Westman, Claire : "OK, I'm going to give you an example." : (00:30:53.789)
Westman, Claire : "Then you can think about this again." : (00:30:55.509)
Westman, Claire : "The particulars, however, are what we experience." : (00:30:57.589)
Westman, Claire : "So the universals are in the world of the forms." : (00:31:02.509)
Westman, Claire : "The particulars are the things that we." : (00:31:07.159)
Westman, Claire : "Experience or perceive?" : (00:31:09.829)
Westman, Claire : "In our material world." : (00:31:13.159)
Westman, Claire : "So these are specific instances of things and it is not true knowledge because it" : (00:31:14.399)
Westman, Claire : "is imperfect and impermanent." : (00:31:22.200)
Westman, Claire : "So let me give you an example." : (00:31:25.479)
Westman, Claire : "We're walking along the road and we see a dock. OK," : (00:31:28.709)
Westman, Claire : "so we can sense particular things about that dog that makes us believe that it is" : (00:31:32.735)
Westman, Claire : "a dog." : (00:31:39.084)
Westman, Claire : "We can feel their fur." : (00:31:41.449)
Westman, Claire : "We maybe we hear them bark if we put our face close to these," : (00:31:43.609)
Westman, Claire : "we can smell their breath." : (00:31:47.526)
Westman, Claire : "We think about that." : (00:31:49.809)
Westman, Claire : "They have we. Well, we can see that they have 4 legs." : (00:31:51.529)
Westman, Claire : "They have a tail, they have ears." : (00:31:54.289)
Westman, Claire : "So when we put that information together based on what we know about dogs," : (00:31:57.329)
Westman, Claire : "we believe that they." : (00:32:04.422)
Westman, Claire : "That that is a dog." : (00:32:07.119)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:32:09.389)
Westman, Claire : "So we have these idea. We already have this idea of universal" : (00:32:10.029)
Westman, Claire : "properties." : (00:32:17.095)
Westman, Claire : "Of a doc. OK, so we might say to ourselves," : (00:32:19.799)
Westman, Claire : "a dog has fur." : (00:32:23.319)
Westman, Claire : "A dog can bark. A dog has four legs. A dog has ears." : (00:32:24.599)
Westman, Claire : "A dog has a tail, so we have these general terms." : (00:32:28.919)
Westman, Claire : "That say that dogs have food, OK, and then we think it." : (00:32:36.589)
Westman, Claire : "Then there would be a form of dog." : (00:32:42.487)
Westman, Claire : "And the dogs that we see that we can sense." : (00:32:47.559)
Westman, Claire : "Are." : (00:32:53.559)
Westman, Claire : "Instances." : (00:32:54.899)
Westman, Claire : "Of the universals that would apply to the term doc, OK." : (00:32:58.199)
Westman, Claire : "But now remember, he says that this isn't we don't have" : (00:33:02.759)
Westman, Claire : "true knowledge of dogness because." : (00:33:07.438)
Westman, Claire : "This dog is imperfect and impermanent." : (00:33:11.739)
Westman, Claire : "It can change." : (00:33:15.699)
Westman, Claire : "So over time, maybe we keep seeing that dog and they're" : (00:33:19.439)
Westman, Claire : "changing all the time." : (00:33:22.741)
Westman, Claire : "Their fur changes colour." : (00:33:24.039)
Westman, Claire : "Maybe they have an accident and they lose a leg." : (00:33:26.679)
Westman, Claire : "Their breast might become smellier as they get older." : (00:33:30.119)
Westman, Claire : "Or." : (00:33:35.239)
Westman, Claire : "We might see another dog now. We still think that's a dog because it's" : (00:33:36.479)
Westman, Claire : "got legs." : (00:33:42.017)
Westman, Claire : "It's got a tail, it's got ears, it's got fur." : (00:33:42.719)
Westman, Claire : "It conforms to our beliefs about a dog, but it's got a it's got different kind of" : (00:33:45.199)
Westman, Claire : "food to the first dog." : (00:33:51.727)
Westman, Claire : "They're a different size to the first dog." : (00:33:54.999)
Westman, Claire : "Their bark sounds different, so we can't then say that we have" : (00:33:56.359)
Westman, Claire : "knowledge of dogs." : (00:34:02.208)
Westman, Claire : "As a form, because the things that we are perceiving" : (00:34:05.429)
Westman, Claire : "and experiencing are changing, they're different." : (00:34:09.463)
Westman, Claire : "So there is imperfect." : (00:34:13.669)
Westman, Claire : "Let's say examples or instances of the form of the dog." : (00:34:17.439)
Westman, Claire : "But we believe they are dogs, so that is why Plato says that the things" : (00:34:24.229)
Westman, Claire : "we can perceive, our beliefs or opinions, they're not true knowledge." : (00:34:28.954)
Westman, Claire : "So we are taking the information that we have." : (00:34:33.749)
Westman, Claire : "And applying it to these particular instances or examples and forming beliefs" : (00:34:38.319)
Westman, Claire : "or opinions about those things." : (00:34:43.958)
Westman, Claire : "But we would need to have. We need to work towards that true" : (00:34:46.519)
Westman, Claire : "knowledge of the form of the dog, which." : (00:34:51.012)
Westman, Claire : "Which would be the perfect, unchanging universal dog." : (00:34:54.309)
Westman, Claire : "In order to have true knowledge of dog or of dogness as he might say it." : (00:35:00.309)
Westman, Claire : "So we only have an idea of what a dog is." : (00:35:07.119)
Westman, Claire : "Not exactly what not true knowledge of what a dog is." : (00:35:10.519)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:35:15.319)
Westman, Claire : "So I hope that's making some sense for you." : (00:35:15.919)
Westman, Claire : "So just remember the forms are universal." : (00:35:18.999)
Westman, Claire : "And they are forms that correlate to basically everything." : (00:35:23.439)
Westman, Claire : "So." : (00:35:29.479)
Westman, Claire : "We might say this, the form of a dog." : (00:35:30.029)
Westman, Claire : "This the form of a cat." : (00:35:32.389)
Westman, Claire : "There's the form of the table." : (00:35:33.629)
Westman, Claire : "There's the form of a box." : (00:35:35.069)
Westman, Claire : "There's the form of also things that we that are not physical but that we can" : (00:35:37.879)
Westman, Claire : "perceive." : (00:35:42.577)
Westman, Claire : "So things like form of justice, form of beauty." : (00:35:43.159)
Westman, Claire : "So we might say that we'll look at an example now actually of that." : (00:35:47.032)
Westman, Claire : "And in the particulars. Sorry, are the things that we experience," : (00:35:54.319)
Westman, Claire : "the examples or instances?" : (00:35:59.197)
Westman, Claire : "When we when we say that we have a belief or an opinion or an idea that something." : (00:36:03.029)
Westman, Claire : "Is what we think it is because of the characteristics." : (00:36:12.619)
Westman, Claire : "Of the particular attributes that that thing has." : (00:36:19.879)
Westman, Claire : "So again, I might say something like the example" : (00:36:23.239)
Westman, Claire : "that's given in the study guide." : (00:36:25.997)
Westman, Claire : "You can look at something and say OK." : (00:36:28.159)
Westman, Claire : "It's square, it's brown." : (00:36:30.399)
Westman, Claire : "You could put things inside of it." : (00:36:33.319)
Westman, Claire : "It's got a lid. Sorry." : (00:36:37.159)
Westman, Claire : "So then we might say, OK." : (00:36:39.799)
Westman, Claire : "Because of those characteristics and those attributes or those properties of" : (00:36:42.469)
Westman, Claire : "that thing we're looking at, we can say it's a box, but they're not." : (00:36:46.983)
Westman, Claire : "All boxes are brown." : (00:36:51.029)
Westman, Claire : "Maybe not all boxes are square, so we don't have true knowledge of a box" : (00:36:53.029)
Westman, Claire : "of box because." : (00:36:59.366)
Westman, Claire : "We are seeing examples that are changing and different." : (00:37:02.079)
Westman, Claire : "They have these particular attributes or characteristics that we think of as a box." : (00:37:05.359)
Westman, Claire : "But they're not that perfect. Universal, unchanging form of box. OK." : (00:37:10.989)
Westman, Claire : "So let's look here at this diagram which I have borrowed from the source at the" : (00:37:17.189)
Westman, Claire : "bottom." : (00:37:21.566)
Westman, Claire : "And so this gives you a very basic sort of breakdown of." : (00:37:23.679)
Westman, Claire : "The Plato's ideas of forms and the physical realm." : (00:37:32.919)
Westman, Claire : "You, you'll see." : (00:37:38.399)
Westman, Claire : "If you go and look on Google, if you Google it," : (00:37:39.869)
Westman, Claire : "you'll see there's more complex versions of this." : (00:37:42.572)
Westman, Claire : "But again, I don't want to go too in depth into this." : (00:37:45.389)
Westman, Claire : "We can come back to it because I just want you to be able to get question three" : (00:37:50.229)
Westman, Claire : "done." : (00:37:55.462)
Westman, Claire : "So that you can." : (00:37:58.739)
Westman, Claire : "Your brain hurts, don't worry." : (00:38:01.559)
Westman, Claire : "I'm sure a lot of people's brains are but fried right now." : (00:38:03.199)
Westman, Claire : "Alejandra, do you have a question before I continue?" : (00:38:06.399)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "Yes, ma'am. I just." : (00:38:12.609)
Westman, Claire : "Somebody's mark is on hold on." : (00:38:15.909)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "Wanted to ask in a way where." : (00:38:16.039)
Westman, Claire : "Leanne, I'm just going to mute you and you can" : (00:38:20.119)
Westman, Claire : "unmute yourself again." : (00:38:22.244)
Westman, Claire : "OK, you can unmute yourself again and ask a" : (00:38:23.999)
Westman, Claire : "question." : (00:38:26.091)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "OK." : (00:38:30.059)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:38:32.199)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "So what?" : (00:38:32.679)
Westman, Claire : "Oh wait." : (00:38:35.269)
Westman, Claire : "Oh, I think sorry. Sorry. My sound was off. Sorry." : (00:38:35.709)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "So I kind of." : (00:38:35.919)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "OK." : (00:38:40.269)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "So basically what Plato was saying, I'm just trying to see if I understand" : (00:38:43.239)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "this." : (00:38:47.251)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "So basically what Plato is saying is that." : (00:38:47.519)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:38:48.309)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "Nothing is true or real because it can take many different forms," : (00:38:52.839)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "so there isn't 1U criteria of something, and because there isn't their fault can't" : (00:38:57.513)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "be real." : (00:39:03.392)
Westman, Claire : "Yes, basically." : (00:39:05.569)
Westman, Claire : "So he's saying that the things that we experience, remember," : (00:39:06.729)
Westman, Claire : "we don't all experience things the same. Not everything that we experience." : (00:39:10.362)
Westman, Claire : "Will conform 100% to our idea of. Again, let's say with the dog." : (00:39:16.599)
Westman, Claire : "We might say that dogs have four legs, but maybe we come across a dog that has" : (00:39:20.955)
Westman, Claire : "three legs or two legs or whatever it is." : (00:39:26.251)
Westman, Claire : "So because those things." : (00:39:29.159)
Westman, Claire : "Because the things we experience are." : (00:39:32.079)
Westman, Claire : "Not identical all the time they're changing." : (00:39:35.959)
Westman, Claire : "They they are not true." : (00:39:41.079)
Westman, Claire : "They're not true knowledge of those things because." : (00:39:42.839)
Westman, Claire : "They are not always the same." : (00:39:47.479)
Westman, Claire : "They're not eternal, they're not universal." : (00:39:48.919)
Westman, Claire : "OK, so you seem to be on the right track" : (00:39:52.799)
Westman, Claire : "there though." : (00:39:54.651)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "OK." : (00:39:56.989)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "Thank you." : (00:39:57.589)
Westman, Claire : "All right, so let's look here." : (00:40:00.589)
Westman, Claire : "We see." : (00:40:02.149)
Westman, Claire : "We see at the very top is the form of beauty." : (00:40:05.109)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:40:09.549)
Westman, Claire : "So this so if if it helps you to think of it, I do sometimes as well." : (00:40:09.749)
Westman, Claire : "So I sometimes think of the world of the forms as out there in the clouds." : (00:40:15.619)
Westman, Claire : "Like you can see it here in this image, this picture." : (00:40:19.828)
Westman, Claire : "The form of beauty is out there beyond our world, OK?" : (00:40:24.709)
Westman, Claire : "It's beyond our mind." : (00:40:29.109)
Westman, Claire : "It's beyond our physical world." : (00:40:31.149)
Westman, Claire : "It exists in a realm in a world beyond us." : (00:40:33.229)
Westman, Claire : "And that is the form of beauty." : (00:40:39.469)
Westman, Claire : "So that is the perfect, unchanging, eternal." : (00:40:40.789)
Westman, Claire : "Universal form of beauty." : (00:40:45.479)
Westman, Claire : "Then we get this." : (00:40:49.589)
Westman, Claire : "Then we get in the next realm is the concept of beauty." : (00:40:51.269)
Westman, Claire : "And now for Plato." : (00:40:55.829)
Westman, Claire : "These are the higher realms because remember he puts reason and rationality" : (00:40:57.389)
Westman, Claire : "above the material world. So in our minds we can think of the idea" : (00:41:02.455)
Westman, Claire : "or the concept of beauty." : (00:41:06.922)
Westman, Claire : "So you might think to yourself about what?" : (00:41:08.669)
Westman, Claire : "In your mind, constitutes beauty." : (00:41:12.789)
Westman, Claire : "But for Plato, that is not the true form of beauty," : (00:41:15.779)
Westman, Claire : "because we have different ideas about what is beautiful." : (00:41:20.110)
Westman, Claire : "We there are different properties or characteristics that we might have about" : (00:41:25.099)
Westman, Claire : "beauty." : (00:41:31.155)
Westman, Claire : "OK. Then we have individual beautiful" : (00:41:33.709)
Westman, Claire : "entities." : (00:41:37.298)
Westman, Claire : "So here we can see this is a bit misogynistic, but we've got a woman." : (00:41:38.229)
Westman, Claire : "We've got a Vaz, we've got nature." : (00:41:45.349)
Westman, Claire : "We've got flowers, so these are individual entities." : (00:41:47.859)
Westman, Claire : "Examples." : (00:41:53.909)
Westman, Claire : "Individual things that we can experience as beautiful, OK." : (00:41:56.469)
Westman, Claire : "And now these are things that we might consider real." : (00:42:00.604)
Westman, Claire : "But according to Plato, they are not real. OK." : (00:42:04.389)
Westman, Claire : "These are instances of things that." : (00:42:07.189)
Westman, Claire : "Have attributes of the form of beauty." : (00:42:15.429)
Westman, Claire : "But are not beauty itself KK." : (00:42:18.459)
Westman, Claire : "Then below that is imitations of beautiful entities." : (00:42:23.179)
Westman, Claire : "So again, in your answer, don't go into too much detail about this," : (00:42:28.419)
Westman, Claire : "but I just want this. I think often gives students a better" : (00:42:33.252)
Westman, Claire : "understanding of it." : (00:42:37.517)
Westman, Claire : "So he says that we have actual physical examples or instances of beautiful things." : (00:42:39.339)
Westman, Claire : "But then beyond that, we get imitations of them," : (00:42:48.709)
Westman, Claire : "which might be photos." : (00:42:51.745)
Westman, Claire : "Reflection, shadows, paintings, etc. OK." : (00:42:53.939)
Westman, Claire : "So we have these different levels of, let's say realness," : (00:42:57.819)
Westman, Claire : "and but the only true real thing is the actual form of beauty." : (00:43:02.919)
Westman, Claire : "I think you'd pronounce it Joaquim." : (00:43:10.029)
Westman, Claire : "Is that correct?" : (00:43:11.829)
Westman, Claire : "I see your hand is up." : (00:43:13.229)
Westman, Claire : "Please correct my pronunciation." : (00:43:16.069)
Westman, Claire : "Looks like to talking, but I can't hear you." : (00:43:22.969)
Westman, Claire : "Is it just me? OK." : (00:43:30.259)
Westman, Claire : "Oh, OK." : (00:43:38.329)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:43:41.089)
Westman, Claire : "OK, then yeah, OK." : (00:43:41.769)
Westman, Claire : "Perfect. Alright." : (00:43:43.809)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:43:45.449)
Westman, Claire : "So let me again give you an example if that will help you." : (00:43:45.929)
Westman, Claire : "So you might let's think of a sunset, we might say, oh," : (00:43:49.249)
Westman, Claire : "that's a beautiful sunset. So now." : (00:43:54.550)
Westman, Claire : "We're we are applying." : (00:43:59.429)
Westman, Claire : "Um, what we consider attributes or" : (00:44:02.709)
Westman, Claire : "characteristics of beauty to our experience of the sun." : (00:44:06.124)
Westman, Claire : "It so I look at the sunset." : (00:44:12.059)
Westman, Claire : "I say wow, that is a beautiful sunset." : (00:44:13.659)
Westman, Claire : "We're looking at particular aspects of it that conform to our ideas of beauty," : (00:44:17.299)
Westman, Claire : "so I might think it's beautiful because it's bright." : (00:44:23.523)
Westman, Claire : "There's so many different colors." : (00:44:28.499)
Westman, Claire : "It's orange and yellow and red, so it's really colorful." : (00:44:30.299)
Westman, Claire : "So because of these things." : (00:44:35.419)
Westman, Claire : "That I think are what makes something." : (00:44:38.109)
Westman, Claire : "Beautiful. Well, that I think makes sunsets beautiful." : (00:44:42.019)
Westman, Claire : "I think that's a beautiful sunset, but then night closes in." : (00:44:45.299)
Westman, Claire : "It gets later and later as time goes on. As the night progresses," : (00:44:49.712)
Westman, Claire : "the colors start to fade away." : (00:44:54.488)
Westman, Claire : "There's no more Reds in the sunset." : (00:44:56.659)
Westman, Claire : "It's now just becoming like a dull yellow, and maybe I don't really like yellow so" : (00:44:59.419)
Westman, Claire : "much." : (00:45:04.059)
Westman, Claire : "The sky becomes dark." : (00:45:05.789)
Westman, Claire : "And we start to lose those things." : (00:45:08.389)
Westman, Claire : "That we think make the sunset beautiful, or that I think," : (00:45:11.099)
Westman, Claire : "make the sunset beautiful." : (00:45:14.717)
Westman, Claire : "So the characteristics or attributes that I associated with it as beautiful have" : (00:45:16.539)
Westman, Claire : "changed or disappeared." : (00:45:23.548)
Westman, Claire : "So I cannot say that it is true." : (00:45:25.859)
Westman, Claire : "It's a true reflection of beauty, or that I know beauty because that sunset" : (00:45:28.659)
Westman, Claire : "no longer exists." : (00:45:35.719)
Westman, Claire : "It's gone away." : (00:45:37.989)
Westman, Claire : "And also." : (00:45:40.069)
Westman, Claire : "Because those are only my experiences of beauty." : (00:45:41.539)
Westman, Claire : "Maybe you don't like sunset." : (00:45:47.829)
Westman, Claire : "Maybe you have astigmatism or an eye condition that makes you hated when it's" : (00:45:49.029)
Westman, Claire : "bright outside, so you don't like sunsets." : (00:45:55.191)
Westman, Claire : "So our perceptions of what is beautiful might be different, but also again," : (00:46:01.019)
Westman, Claire : "remember Plato says that if things are, if they change or they decay," : (00:46:07.099)
Westman, Claire : "or they fade, they cannot." : (00:46:12.699)
Westman, Claire : "Be the real knowledge of that thing. Because of those changes and decay." : (00:46:16.749)
Westman, Claire : "OK, Joaquim, I see your hand is back up." : (00:46:25.459)
Westman, Claire : "OK. Again, it looks like you're talking, but I can't hear you." : (00:46:37.179)
Westman, Claire : "OK. All right." : (00:46:46.749)
Westman, Claire : "A Mac issue. Uh. Technology. OK, you can ask." : (00:46:49.499)
Westman, Claire : "Yeah, you can put your question in the chat and" : (00:46:53.259)
Westman, Claire : "I will come back to the questions." : (00:46:55.202)
Westman, Claire : "It's just and I see there's quite a lot of ideas going on," : (00:46:56.579)
Westman, Claire : "so I'll come back to them." : (00:46:59.799)
Westman, Claire : "They just just can't have the chat open, otherwise I'm getting distracted." : (00:47:01.219)
Westman, Claire : "Luyanda, do you have another question?" : (00:47:05.499)
Westman, Claire : "Or is it a?" : (00:47:09.549)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "Yeah." : (00:47:10.179)
Westman, Claire : "Yes." : (00:47:12.819)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "So would you have an example of what Plato thought was true knowledge?" : (00:47:13.789)
Westman, Claire : "Well, so for Plato, true knowledge is working towards knowing" : (00:47:22.459)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "Of something." : (00:47:22.659)
Westman, Claire : "the form of that thing." : (00:47:27.506)
Westman, Claire : "And now this is where it's tricky because he doesn't really tell us what" : (00:47:29.379)
Westman, Claire : "constitutes that thing." : (00:47:36.709)
Westman, Claire : "So if he says that there's dogness, we don't know exactly what constitutes" : (00:47:39.019)
Westman, Claire : "the form of the dog." : (00:47:44.924)
Westman, Claire : "He says he kind of just expects that we would." : (00:47:47.589)
Westman, Claire : "That this dogness exists." : (00:47:52.179)
Westman, Claire : "That could it be applied to all dogs and that." : (00:47:55.989)
Westman, Claire : "He says that." : (00:48:01.629)
Westman, Claire : "Particulars he puts it as particulars. Participate in the form." : (00:48:04.029)
Westman, Claire : "So if something is beautiful, then the those particular instances" : (00:48:09.189)
Westman, Claire : "participate in the form of beauty." : (00:48:15.102)
Westman, Claire : "But he never really specifies what exactly." : (00:48:18.149)
Westman, Claire : "Exactly, beauty. What exactly?" : (00:48:22.139)
Westman, Claire : "The form of beauty would be he just says that we have these forms." : (00:48:25.059)
Westman, Claire : "Our soul knows our soul is up there with those forms." : (00:48:30.094)
Westman, Claire : "We can work towards knowledge of the forms," : (00:48:34.153)
Westman, Claire : "but we he doesn't really give us an idea of what exactly." : (00:48:37.460)
Westman, Claire : "Those forms are he just says that there's a form that relates to everything." : (00:48:43.229)
Westman, Claire : "But." : (00:48:50.949)
Westman, Claire : "It is a bit tricky, so this is kind of one of the one of the" : (00:48:52.019)
Westman, Claire : "sort of critiques against Plato." : (00:48:57.135)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "OK, OK." : (00:49:01.529)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:49:02.739)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "Thank you." : (00:49:02.849)
Westman, Claire : "KJ." : (00:49:04.949)
Westman, Claire : "OK, so that is a very that's a basic." : (00:49:06.899)
Westman, Claire : "Idea of the Plato sort of hierarchy of knowledge starting with imitations at the" : (00:49:12.469)
Westman, Claire : "bottom is the like. Very lowest kind of." : (00:49:19.618)
Westman, Claire : "Sort of." : (00:49:26.899)
Westman, Claire : "I don't want to say knowledge because it's not a belief or opinion you can have" : (00:49:27.579)
Westman, Claire : "about something." : (00:49:31.645)
Westman, Claire : "Then there's the actual things that exist but that are not true knowledge." : (00:49:32.459)
Westman, Claire : "And we have our concepts which are from our mind, which he thinks is." : (00:49:38.139)
Westman, Claire : "You know more." : (00:49:44.389)
Westman, Claire : "It was superior to material world, but still not great." : (00:49:45.869)
Westman, Claire : "And then we have the forms, the world of the forms. OK." : (00:49:49.669)
Westman, Claire : "So." : (00:49:56.589)
Westman, Claire : "What so?" : (00:49:56.869)
Westman, Claire : "Hi, Todd." : (00:49:58.279)
Westman, Claire : "It's the analogy of the cable, the allegory of The Cave," : (00:49:58.759)
Westman, Claire : "and he uses this to kind of explain." : (00:50:03.049)
Westman, Claire : "The our pursuit of knowledge." : (00:50:07.259)
Westman, Claire : "So again, you don't necessarily have to go into" : (00:50:10.679)
Westman, Claire : "this in detail in your question or in your answer," : (00:50:14.605)
Westman, Claire : "but just so that you have this idea, you kind of see what he's talking about." : (00:50:18.778)
Westman, Claire : "And let me just tell you, there are so many videos and articles," : (00:50:26.149)
Westman, Claire : "but a lot of videos." : (00:50:31.502)
Westman, Claire : "Explaining the allegory of The Cave. So if you're not getting all the stuff" : (00:50:34.559)
Westman, Claire : "about the forms, remember, and the allegory. Remember," : (00:50:39.316)
Westman, Claire : "there are many, many resources available to you," : (00:50:42.759)
Westman, Claire : "and the way I explain something might not be the way that you understand it best." : (00:50:45.826)
Westman, Claire : "You might find another." : (00:50:50.959)
Westman, Claire : "Person explains it in a way that you understand better." : (00:50:52.399)
Westman, Claire : "In the videos, obviously there's more motion and there's," : (00:50:56.509)
Westman, Claire : "you know, different kinds of ways of explaining." : (00:50:59.761)
Westman, Claire : "So if you're not getting it, obviously ask me as well if you want to," : (00:51:02.509)
Westman, Claire : "but always make sure you also just go look for other resources." : (00:51:07.148)
Westman, Claire : "So many." : (00:51:11.389)
Westman, Claire : "Many, many, many videos about the allegory of The" : (00:51:12.429)
Westman, Claire : "Cave, so you can go watch those as well." : (00:51:15.918)
Westman, Claire : "But basically what?" : (00:51:20.319)
Westman, Claire : "The allegory of The Cave says." : (00:51:21.999)
Westman, Claire : "And again, this is just going to be a very brief" : (00:51:23.479)
Westman, Claire : "summary." : (00:51:25.576)
Westman, Claire : "Of it is, Plato says, that we must imagine that there are" : (00:51:26.349)
Westman, Claire : "people who have been living in a cave, so they've lived in a cave their whole" : (00:51:30.380)
Westman, Claire : "life." : (00:51:35.801)
Westman, Claire : "So this picture gives you a little bit idea." : (00:51:36.149)
Westman, Claire : "These people have lived in a cave for their whole life." : (00:51:38.430)
Westman, Claire : "You can see there." : (00:51:43.279)
Westman, Claire : "Sorry, they've lived in The Cave." : (00:51:44.279)
Westman, Claire : "And there is ignore that that there's a fire behind them." : (00:51:48.359)
Westman, Claire : "So these people are here, they they chained to a wall." : (00:51:52.599)
Westman, Claire : "Inside The Cave." : (00:51:57.069)
Westman, Claire : "They have this fire behind them." : (00:51:59.639)
Westman, Claire : "And then there are people walking." : (00:52:02.639)
Westman, Claire : "In between them and the fire." : (00:52:05.639)
Westman, Claire : "And they're holding different things. So they're holding different objects." : (00:52:08.559)
Westman, Claire : "And so the prisoners that are sitting there facing the back of The Cave," : (00:52:14.439)
Westman, Claire : "they will see here, which is particulars. They will see these shadows on the wall." : (00:52:19.923)
Westman, Claire : "So these people, the people who walk past carrying these" : (00:52:27.569)
Westman, Claire : "things, maybe other animals actually do come in." : (00:52:30.688)
Westman, Claire : "They walk in front of the fire and it makes these reflections onto the back of" : (00:52:33.369)
Westman, Claire : "the wall." : (00:52:39.330)
Westman, Claire : "But now these prisoners have never been outside of The Cave." : (00:52:40.449)
Westman, Claire : "So when they see these things and they can't look behind them, they can." : (00:52:45.329)
Westman, Claire : "There's only the wall behind them, so they don't know there are these people" : (00:52:49.569)
Westman, Claire : "carrying things." : (00:52:53.303)
Westman, Claire : "So the reflections that they see on the wall they think are real." : (00:52:55.629)
Westman, Claire : "They think that is real knowledge of the things that are behind them." : (00:53:01.149)
Westman, Claire : "But now when we're looking at this, we know, oh, OK." : (00:53:06.509)
Westman, Claire : "They're only just seeing these reflections of the objects that are being" : (00:53:09.069)
Westman, Claire : "carried by the people, so the fire is illuminating these objects," : (00:53:14.650)
Westman, Claire : "causing shadows on the wall of the back of The Cave." : (00:53:19.696)
Westman, Claire : "And that's what the prisoners see." : (00:53:24.479)
Westman, Claire : "But because that's all the prisoners have experienced," : (00:53:26.819)
Westman, Claire : "that's all the perception they have of the world." : (00:53:30.360)
Westman, Claire : "They think that those things are real." : (00:53:33.979)
Westman, Claire : "So we can see that they only have a belief or an opinion." : (00:53:37.869)
Westman, Claire : "They don't have real knowledge." : (00:53:41.284)
Westman, Claire : "So Plato says that in this allegory that the prisoners managed to get free." : (00:53:44.599)
Westman, Claire : "And they realized that they can escape The Cave, so they climb up." : (00:53:51.879)
Westman, Claire : "They try and ascend to knowledge, so they try to escape The Cave." : (00:53:56.359)
Westman, Claire : "They get out of The Cave and they the world is so bright." : (00:54:01.617)
Westman, Claire : "So now they've been stuck in this cave." : (00:54:06.239)
Westman, Claire : "Whatever the world is so bright, it's so loud. Umm," : (00:54:08.189)
Westman, Claire : "they're seeing actual animals, so they're scared and they become" : (00:54:12.208)
Westman, Claire : "overwhelmed in the world outside of The Cave." : (00:54:17.233)
Westman, Claire : "But this is what he says we should be doing." : (00:54:21.109)
Westman, Claire : "We are." : (00:54:23.909)
Westman, Claire : "We should unshackle ourselves from this cave, which is." : (00:54:24.469)
Westman, Claire : "Our material world and our sensory experiences." : (00:54:30.599)
Westman, Claire : "And we should try to ascend out of The Cave towards the realm." : (00:54:33.079)
Westman, Claire : "Of the forms, which is true knowledge." : (00:54:37.989)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:54:42.079)
Westman, Claire : "But if we're thinking of these prisoners, they come out of The Cave." : (00:54:42.479)
Westman, Claire : "Some of the prisoners find it too overwhelming." : (00:54:46.678)
Westman, Claire : "So they go back into The Cave." : (00:54:49.639)
Westman, Claire : "But when they go back into The Cave, the prisoners that were kept there think" : (00:54:53.549)
Westman, Claire : "that they are lying because now they've never experienced anything else." : (00:54:58.012)
Westman, Claire : "So they think that these prisoners who have been out of The Cave and come back" : (00:55:02.189)
Westman, Claire : "and tell them about their experiences, they don't believe that they are telling" : (00:55:07.541)
Westman, Claire : "the truth. But in any case, let's say one prisoner makes it out of" : (00:55:12.960)
Westman, Claire : "The Cave." : (00:55:17.499)
Westman, Claire : "And he doesn't become he or she." : (00:55:18.839)
Westman, Claire : "They don't become too overwhelmed." : (00:55:21.359)
Westman, Claire : "Films by being out in the world beyond The Cave, then they start to see, oh," : (00:55:23.389)
Westman, Claire : "there's a there's a tree." : (00:55:29.337)
Westman, Claire : "There's an actual horse." : (00:55:32.719)
Westman, Claire : "There's an, you know, there's water." : (00:55:35.319)
Westman, Claire : "So they realize that those things that they were seeing in The Cave were only" : (00:55:37.079)
Westman, Claire : "shadows or reflections of these things that exist in the world beyond The Cave." : (00:55:43.338)
Westman, Claire : "So Plato is using this as a way for us to." : (00:55:49.839)
Westman, Claire : "Think about our minds and our experiences and our and the different levels of" : (00:55:53.469)
Westman, Claire : "knowledge and truth." : (00:55:59.772)
Westman, Claire : "So he says that if we get stuck in our bodies, in our experiences," : (00:56:02.919)
Westman, Claire : "we can be fooled into thinking that the things that we perceive or experience are" : (00:56:08.585)
Westman, Claire : "real. However, once we know once we have this" : (00:56:15.520)
Westman, Claire : "understanding that what we experience isn't true." : (00:56:19.410)
Westman, Claire : "Through or isn't real knowledge we can work our way up towards gaining knowledge." : (00:56:23.989)
Westman, Claire : "We work our way up by using reason and rationality," : (00:56:31.229)
Westman, Claire : "and we try and ascend towards the realm of the forms we unburden ourselves." : (00:56:35.762)
Westman, Claire : "Of." : (00:56:43.799)
Westman, Claire : "Relying on sensory experience, we start to use our reason and" : (00:56:44.629)
Westman, Claire : "rationality and prioritise reason and rationality in order to work towards the" : (00:56:49.868)
Westman, Claire : "realm of the forms." : (00:56:56.543)
Westman, Claire : "And in this realm of the forms, we can see that the." : (00:56:59.639)
Westman, Claire : "Sun is it illuminates everything. OK, so in the world," : (00:57:05.919)
Westman, Claire : "the sun illuminates everything." : (00:57:10.779)
Westman, Claire : "The sun, once the prisoner gets out of The Cave." : (00:57:13.949)
Westman, Claire : "The sun illuminates the world now that he's in so because of the light from the" : (00:57:17.189)
Westman, Claire : "sun, he's able to experience the trees, the horse, the water, the grass." : (00:57:23.212)
Westman, Claire : "He's able to experience the world and we will see now that for Plato," : (00:57:28.749)
Westman, Claire : "the Sun is an analogy of the form of the good." : (00:57:35.545)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (00:57:41.669)
Westman, Claire : "So try and think of it like that if it helps you. We're shackled here, he says." : (00:57:42.589)
Westman, Claire : "In our material world, we experience things." : (00:57:48.548)
Westman, Claire : "We have these perceptions that fools us into thinking that these things that we" : (00:57:51.900)
Westman, Claire : "can experience and perceive our knowledge." : (00:57:57.860)
Westman, Claire : "But he says that's not true knowledge." : (00:58:01.029)
Westman, Claire : "Those are reflections or particular objects." : (00:58:03.029)
Westman, Claire : "So he says that we need to then use reason." : (00:58:06.719)
Westman, Claire : "And rationality, we need to try and ascend." : (00:58:10.879)
Westman, Claire : "Towards actual knowledge, which is the realm of the forms." : (00:58:13.429)
Westman, Claire : "So we try and come out of The Cave to the realm of the forms." : (00:58:17.349)
Westman, Claire : "We try and free ourselves from being burdened by only thinking we know through" : (00:58:22.349)
Westman, Claire : "our sensory experience." : (00:58:29.443)
Westman, Claire : "So we go from what he says is illusion to truth, OK." : (00:58:31.509)
Westman, Claire : "So then that brings us to the form of the good." : (00:58:38.399)
Westman, Claire : "So, like the sun in the allegory of The Cave." : (00:58:40.359)
Westman, Claire : "If all illuminates the world and allows us to see or experience things in the" : (00:58:44.229)
Westman, Claire : "world, the form of the good illuminates all" : (00:58:51.819)
Westman, Claire : "other forms." : (00:58:56.101)
Westman, Claire : "So for Plato, the form of the good." : (00:58:57.509)
Westman, Claire : "Is the most superior." : (00:59:02.439)
Westman, Claire : "It's the highest form of all the forms, so he says in our pursuit of seeking the" : (00:59:03.919)
Westman, Claire : "form of the good. That is how we come to." : (00:59:10.319)
Westman, Claire : "Attain knowledge of the other forms. So without the form of the good we cannot" : (00:59:13.949)
Westman, Claire : "get knowledge of the form of justice, the form of beauty, the form of." : (00:59:18.899)
Westman, Claire : "Anything. So we need to we need to pursue knowledge" : (00:59:24.919)
Westman, Claire : "of the form of the good in order to gain knowledge and truth of other forms of" : (00:59:28.869)
Westman, Claire : "other things in order to gain knowledge we have to try and pursue the form of the" : (00:59:34.870)
Westman, Claire : "good." : (00:59:41.099)
Westman, Claire : "So our lives are directed to finding knowledge of the highest good." : (00:59:43.279)
Westman, Claire : "So it's like a light that guides our souls or our minds." : (00:59:47.839)
Westman, Claire : "So like in The Cave, we're trying to get rid of our shackles." : (00:59:54.079)
Westman, Claire : "That chain us to the wall and keep us confined to The Cave." : (00:59:57.392)
Westman, Claire : "Plato thinks that in pursuit of knowledge of the highest good, we are unshackled." : (01:00:02.319)
Westman, Claire : "Or we overcome our mortal or physical limitations and our imperfect sense" : (01:00:07.599)
Westman, Claire : "perceptions, which are our opinions or beliefs or" : (01:00:11.770)
Westman, Claire : "beliefs." : (01:00:14.588)
Westman, Claire : "And we are able to then work towards knowledge." : (01:00:15.879)
Westman, Claire : "So he says that in that pursuit of working towards knowledge of the good." : (01:00:21.789)
Westman, Claire : "We are able to attain knowledge of justice of all these other things." : (01:00:28.499)
Westman, Claire : "And it does explain this in your study guide." : (01:00:36.909)
Westman, Claire : "But we are able to work towards." : (01:00:38.789)
Westman, Claire : "That knowledge of these other things, and it is that pursuit of the good." : (01:00:43.949)
Westman, Claire : "That helps us to live a virtuous life. So to live a virtuous life or to find" : (01:00:49.469)
Westman, Claire : "virtue." : (01:00:56.729)
Westman, Claire : "We must be in pursuit of the knowledge of the good, and for Plato," : (01:00:58.059)
Westman, Claire : "virtue is not just the way we behave." : (01:01:03.496)
Westman, Claire : "It's not just our external behaviours, it's a state of being and it's the state" : (01:01:06.499)
Westman, Claire : "of being in which you are pursuing the knowledge of the form of the good. OK," : (01:01:12.865)
Westman, Claire : "so he says if we put our efforts." : (01:01:19.073)
Westman, Claire : "Into trying to know the form of the good." : (01:01:22.829)
Westman, Claire : "We will then live a life that is just and ethical and we will live in moderation" : (01:01:27.349)
Westman, Claire : "and those are attributes that help us to live a virtuous life." : (01:01:34.526)
Westman, Claire : "And it is those attributes that help us to work towards knowledge of the good." : (01:01:41.629)
Westman, Claire : "So it's letting go of." : (01:01:46.109)
Westman, Claire : "Our appetites which so I don't want to get into too much, but Plato says." : (01:01:51.419)
Westman, Claire : "Our material world or our sense experiences," : (01:01:59.589)
Westman, Claire : "they are tied to our appetite." : (01:02:01.893)
Westman, Claire : "So he wants us to let go of these material experiences or let go of" : (01:02:03.429)
Westman, Claire : "prioritizing material expenses." : (01:02:09.748)
Westman, Claire : "Experiences, not expenses and." : (01:02:14.349)
Westman, Claire : "Focus more on rationality." : (01:02:18.109)
Westman, Claire : "Reason and that involves moderation. Thinking about justice," : (01:02:20.379)
Westman, Claire : "thinking about ethical living." : (01:02:26.921)
Westman, Claire : "Thinking about courage." : (01:02:31.549)
Westman, Claire : "So there's various specific attributes that Plato mentioned," : (01:02:32.469)
Westman, Claire : "but using our reason and rationality and working towards knowledge of the good" : (01:02:37.109)
Westman, Claire : "allows us to understand or have knowledge of these other attributes that." : (01:02:43.119)
Westman, Claire : "Help us to." : (01:02:51.149)
Westman, Claire : "Laugh. OK, luyanda." : (01:02:52.339)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "So when we answer the question, are we answering the question from the" : (01:03:01.979)
Westman, Claire : "Yes." : (01:03:04.879)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "perspective of the definition of virtue during the Greek times or the modern day" : (01:03:06.979)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "definition?" : (01:03:12.684)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "'Cause I think I'm getting confused as well because the way you're explaining it," : (01:03:13.699)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "you're making it sound like we're answering based off of the modern day" : (01:03:18.516)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "definition of virtue." : (01:03:22.745)
Westman, Claire : "So I'm just trying to think here." : (01:03:30.179)
Westman, Claire : "Remember, you need to think about what, what Plato would consider a good life." : (01:03:34.869)
Westman, Claire : "So there's things like moderation, courage." : (01:03:40.229)
Westman, Claire : "Rationality. So those are things that make a virtuous" : (01:03:44.549)
Westman, Claire : "life." : (01:03:47.368)
Westman, Claire : "Not necessarily. Things that we might think of as virtue," : (01:03:49.389)
Westman, Claire : "as like philanthropy, you know, helping others, that kind of thing." : (01:03:53.329)
Westman, Claire : "So when you're answering, you need to type into what Plato would" : (01:03:58.499)
Westman, Claire : "consider a virtuous life, OK." : (01:04:03.616)
Westman, Claire : "So in the study guide." : (01:04:05.899)
Westman, Claire : "This is something I wanted to mention as well." : (01:04:09.909)
Westman, Claire : "You need to look also at Plato's ideas of ethics," : (01:04:11.789)
Westman, Claire : "which are on pages 82 to around 84, and that gives you a better idea of" : (01:04:16.085)
Westman, Claire : "specifically what Plato thinks of morality, virtue, ethics." : (01:04:22.273)
Westman, Claire : "6 and so you need to then think about how that ties into." : (01:04:27.699)
Westman, Claire : "The form of the good and working towards knowledge of the form of the good." : (01:04:34.789)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "OK." : (01:04:42.379)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:04:43.329)
Westman, Claire : "So yeah, so just go look at pages 82 to 84 as well." : (01:04:43.729)
Westman, Claire : "And obviously when you're answering because the question is specifically" : (01:04:47.372)
Westman, Claire : "about what does Plato, how could we understand?" : (01:04:52.486)
Westman, Claire : "Why did virtue depend on knowledge?" : (01:04:59.519)
Westman, Claire : "You must go look at what Plato's ideas of morality, ethics, and goodness entail, OK?" : (01:05:03.669)
Westman, Claire : "Correct." : (01:05:13.459)
Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane : "OK." : (01:05:14.779)
Westman, Claire : "Oh, sorry. OK." : (01:05:15.739)
Westman, Claire : "So that's what I wanted to cover with you today again." : (01:05:17.179)
Westman, Claire : "I know we're not going into a lot of detail," : (01:05:20.459)
Westman, Claire : "but I also know this can be very overwhelming." : (01:05:23.354)
Westman, Claire : "So some of you have a good underst or have an understanding of this already." : (01:05:26.379)
Westman, Claire : "I know you have questions that are more specific about the forms," : (01:05:30.979)
Westman, Claire : "about ideas of virtue." : (01:05:36.319)
Westman, Claire : "So, as Joaquim asked as well." : (01:05:40.069)
Westman, Claire : "Well, but I don't want it to become too complex" : (01:05:44.579)
Westman, Claire : "at this stage because I know this is very overwhelming for most people at this" : (01:05:49.429)
Westman, Claire : "point." : (01:05:57.412)
Westman, Claire : "Most students at this point or for a lot of students at this point." : (01:05:58.019)
Westman, Claire : "So if you are." : (01:06:03.469)
Westman, Claire : "If you already have an understanding which I can see that some of you do," : (01:06:06.309)
Westman, Claire : "then you are able you you can go look at making a more complex argument." : (01:06:10.779)
Westman, Claire : "But for everybody else right now, I just have tried to keep it." : (01:06:16.099)
Westman, Claire : "Sort of to the basic." : (01:06:21.819)
Westman, Claire : "Or fundamental sort of ideas that you need." : (01:06:24.989)
Westman, Claire : "For this question, OK, so." : (01:06:29.589)
Westman, Claire : "Yeah, I'm sorry. We're not getting into more specific" : (01:06:33.669)
Westman, Claire : "details for those of you who have some understanding already." : (01:06:37.672)
Westman, Claire : "I just know that a lot of people have sort of struggled with the assignment and" : (01:06:43.869)
Westman, Claire : "are already feeling a bit overwhelmed and out of their depth." : (01:06:48.331)
Westman, Claire : "So I don't wanna ask." : (01:06:52.219)
Westman, Claire : "I don't wanna go into too much detail yet." : (01:06:56.389)
Westman, Claire : "I know, I said." : (01:06:58.949)
Westman, Claire : "We chat about Parmenides soon, but again for this for the last two" : (01:06:59.019)
Westman, Claire : "sessions I only want to focus on the three questions for your assignment" : (01:07:04.105)
Westman, Claire : "because it's due tomorrow. You don't need to discuss Parmenides in" : (01:07:09.647)
Westman, Claire : "your answers for the questions, so we are going to keep that we." : (01:07:14.734)
Westman, Claire : "Can look at that next week." : (01:07:19.669)
Westman, Claire : "We can go back." : (01:07:22.299)
Westman, Claire : "To sort of looking at Unit 1 in more detail and going into that in more detail" : (01:07:25.269)
Westman, Claire : "then, OK, so some of the things you might want to" : (01:07:30.826)
Westman, Claire : "think about or do you think there is a realm of ideal forms of these?" : (01:07:34.344)
Westman, Claire : "This realm of perfect, unchanging universal forms." : (01:07:41.189)
Westman, Claire : "Do you think I'm under separate from my body or do you think we have a soul?" : (01:07:47.769)
Westman, Claire : "That is separate from our bodies and this is a very big topic in philosophy." : (01:07:52.789)
Westman, Claire : "The idea of dualism, materialism." : (01:07:59.453)
Westman, Claire : "So dualism is where you think you've got a soul that's separate from your body." : (01:08:02.309)
Westman, Claire : "Materialism says that your soul." : (01:08:06.149)
Westman, Claire : "Is your brain." : (01:08:10.349)
Westman, Claire : "That your soul is just." : (01:08:12.269)
Westman, Claire : "Well, virtual, they say that your mind is your soul," : (01:08:14.869)
Westman, Claire : "but your mind is just a material." : (01:08:16.989)
Westman, Claire : "Aspect as well." : (01:08:18.819)
Westman, Claire : "So what do you think?" : (01:08:20.939)
Westman, Claire : "And we're not gonna get into all of this now because again," : (01:08:22.779)
Westman, Claire : "this was supposed to be a short lesson, and we almost had an hour and a half." : (01:08:25.405)
Westman, Claire : "Do we need to seek knowledge of the good in order to live virtuously? And here," : (01:08:30.629)
Westman, Claire : "what do you think of virtue?" : (01:08:35.695)
Westman, Claire : "Might not be exactly what Plato thinks of his virtue." : (01:08:37.469)
Westman, Claire : "So go and just check that as well for yourselves." : (01:08:40.109)
Westman, Claire : "So do you agree with the idea of the forms or not?" : (01:08:44.189)
Westman, Claire : "Out." : (01:08:47.979)
Westman, Claire : "And then think about objections to Plato's arguments, OK." : (01:08:48.899)
Westman, Claire : "So there are some in the study guide, but obviously you can go and look for" : (01:08:55.669)
Westman, Claire : "more as well in your own research. OK, I'm going to quickly look at some of the" : (01:09:00.658)
Westman, Claire : "chat, see if there's anything, any answer straight away." : (01:09:05.909)
Westman, Claire : "But I see there's a lot of discuss." : (01:09:09.651)
Westman, Claire : "So I don't know if I'll go through all of it." : (01:09:12.229)
Westman, Claire : "Sure. OK." : (01:09:17.979)
Westman, Claire : "Yeah, there's a lot of chat here." : (01:09:19.099)
Westman, Claire : "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, yes." : (01:09:21.139)
Westman, Claire : "OK. Sounds like you're saying that we can" : (01:09:27.539)
Westman, Claire : "know what a horse is." : (01:09:30.259)
Westman, Claire : "Armchair reflection because there's this perfect form of a horse that exists that" : (01:09:32.179)
Westman, Claire : "we can recollect from our time. OK." : (01:09:36.636)
Westman, Claire : "It doesn't make sense to you." : (01:09:41.539)
Westman, Claire : "Perfectly acceptable if it doesn't make sense to you." : (01:09:43.659)
Westman, Claire : "I'll be honest, I'm not entirely sold on the idea of." : (01:09:49.459)
Westman, Claire : "Plato's ideas either." : (01:09:55.629)
Westman, Claire : "If the soul is superior to the material body," : (01:09:58.029)
Westman, Claire : "wouldn't that mean that the things that the soul knows or experienced is going to" : (01:10:00.367)
Westman, Claire : "make the material body experience deja vu?" : (01:10:04.534)
Westman, Claire : "Because, well, that's kind of what you say." : (01:10:06.709)
Westman, Claire : "Almost like a deja vu." : (01:10:10.749)
Westman, Claire : "And again, this is getting into much more specific" : (01:10:13.989)
Westman, Claire : "complex." : (01:10:18.103)
Westman, Claire : "Topics I don't want to go there just yet, but things about like a priori knowledge" : (01:10:19.099)
Westman, Claire : "and a posteriori knowledge." : (01:10:24.501)
Westman, Claire : "So the idea that we have this knowledge already imply kind of implanted in US or" : (01:10:26.259)
Westman, Claire : "available to us when we're born or when we come to exist." : (01:10:33.578)
Westman, Claire : "So yeah, that's it's a." : (01:10:40.709)
Westman, Claire : "It becomes a very complex concept and it's a a very big topic." : (01:10:43.349)
Westman, Claire : "In philosophy, especially philosophy of mind," : (01:10:51.779)
Westman, Claire : "like how do we?" : (01:10:54.493)
Westman, Claire : "How can we have knowledge that is already exists?" : (01:10:55.379)
Westman, Claire : "So some philosophers, for example, believe that we don't have knowledge" : (01:11:01.459)
Westman, Claire : "exactly, but we have structures." : (01:11:05.834)
Westman, Claire : "Into which we can categorize information that already exists when we are born." : (01:11:10.089)
Westman, Claire : "So it becomes very tricky, but I'm very excited to see a lot of you" : (01:11:16.209)
Westman, Claire : "thinking about these things already and sort of coming up with these questions" : (01:11:20.197)
Westman, Claire : "and coming up with these ideas." : (01:11:24.831)
Westman, Claire : "If something happens, you get a weird feeling." : (01:11:32.969)
Westman, Claire : "It's happened before, OK?" : (01:11:35.580)
Westman, Claire : "OK, some of these are just replying to others." : (01:11:42.229)
Westman, Claire : "My brain hurts, yes." : (01:11:47.819)
Allison Megan McAllister : "Lectures. Lectures." : (01:11:49.329)
Westman, Claire : "Allison, is that a question or have you put your" : (01:11:57.109)
Westman, Claire : "mark on by accident?" : (01:11:59.523)
Allison Megan McAllister : "Put it on by accident." : (01:12:03.319)
Westman, Claire : "OK, something like the world we see here, smile, etc." : (01:12:04.959)
Westman, Claire : "Is the one that isn't real, yes." : (01:12:09.799)
Westman, Claire : "OK, we see here, smell etcetera. Is the one that isn't real because" : (01:12:13.819)
Westman, Claire : "there's no perfect and unchanging instance of a particular thing. Yes," : (01:12:17.378)
Westman, Claire : "that's it." : (01:12:21.095)
Westman, Claire : "Uh." : (01:12:26.149)
Westman, Claire : "OK, something about Jaden Smith." : (01:12:30.599)
Westman, Claire : "I'm enjoying these comics, but yeah, I'm not gonna read out them all out loud." : (01:12:36.259)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:12:42.859)
Westman, Claire : "Some turn to religion." : (01:12:43.019)
Westman, Claire : "There's one comment here that philosophy wasn't in favour of God because it" : (01:12:51.939)
Westman, Claire : "believes in reason." : (01:12:55.683)
Westman, Claire : "There's a whole branch of philosophy related to philosophy of religion," : (01:12:56.939)
Westman, Claire : "and for example, later in this module." : (01:13:04.165)
Westman, Claire : "You will deal with some of some philosophers arguments for the existence" : (01:13:09.539)
Westman, Claire : "of God." : (01:13:14.685)
Westman, Claire : "And some of them, some of them use ideas around logic." : (01:13:16.859)
Westman, Claire : "And reason in order to argue for God." : (01:13:21.209)
Westman, Claire : "So philosophy is certainly not dismissive of religion." : (01:13:25.009)
Westman, Claire : "A lot of philosophy actually entails religion or a belief in God." : (01:13:31.419)
Westman, Claire : "So you will get. You will get to see that a bit later on." : (01:13:38.939)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:13:45.339)
Westman, Claire : "Proof of the existence of God. Yes, we will look at Aquinas and and some." : (01:13:45.739)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:13:55.079)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:13:59.619)
Westman, Claire : "Yeah, sorry. I'm just trying to get through these." : (01:14:00.019)
Westman, Claire : "Plato was very vague, yeah." : (01:14:02.739)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:14:07.099)
Westman, Claire : "I mean, yeah, there's some really interesting things" : (01:14:08.539)
Westman, Claire : "here that I'm not going to get into all of these now." : (01:14:12.085)
Westman, Claire : "Yeah. And we will look more specifically at" : (01:14:19.959)
Westman, Claire : "interpretations of God and religion and ideas about that when we get to that" : (01:14:22.483)
Westman, Claire : "section." : (01:14:26.900)
Westman, Claire : "So we're not going to look at that now." : (01:14:27.359)
Westman, Claire : "Yes. So somebody says." : (01:14:34.519)
Westman, Claire : "So this is quite relevant if the spirit far surpasses the material body." : (01:14:36.279)
Westman, Claire : "There's a spiritual world, meaning that there are spirits." : (01:14:40.505)
Westman, Claire : "Doesn't that mean this is not the first body my spirit has lived in," : (01:14:43.922)
Westman, Claire : "but is another embodiment which will decay," : (01:14:47.917)
Westman, Claire : "allowing it to return from where it." : (01:14:50.464)
Westman, Claire : "Came and coming back as a different person." : (01:14:52.539)
Westman, Claire : "So this is kind of something that Plato says, he says that." : (01:14:54.239)
Westman, Claire : "The soul will." : (01:14:59.419)
Westman, Claire : "The soul is in the realm of the forms." : (01:15:00.939)
Westman, Claire : "But when we die, our soul might return to the forms," : (01:15:04.529)
Westman, Claire : "but then it can come back to a body." : (01:15:09.102)
Westman, Claire : "So again there we're getting into like a little bit of realm of like reincarnation." : (01:15:12.209)
Westman, Claire : "But you can have a look at that." : (01:15:20.219)
Westman, Claire : "There is a small discussion about that in the study guide," : (01:15:22.579)
Westman, Claire : "so I won't go into it now because we are really over time," : (01:15:25.912)
Westman, Claire : "but very interesting point. You can go read that and maybe do some of" : (01:15:29.246)
Westman, Claire : "your own research." : (01:15:33.202)
Westman, Claire : "Urgency. What do you think about that?" : (01:15:34.529)
Westman, Claire : "If you haven't tapped into something you don't have the raw sensory understanding" : (01:15:41.239)
Westman, Claire : "of it." : (01:15:44.556)
Westman, Claire : "So how's it any form of sensory experience?" : (01:15:44.799)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:15:52.059)
Westman, Claire : "OK, alright. Yeah, let me quickly go through these." : (01:15:56.769)
Westman, Claire : "Somebody use computer crashed." : (01:16:04.429)
Westman, Claire : "Please e-mail me directly." : (01:16:06.509)
Westman, Claire : "A lot of chechia." : (01:16:25.489)
Westman, Claire : "Are we allowed to give examples we in supporting our argument?" : (01:16:29.209)
Westman, Claire : "Yes, if you want to, you absolutely can." : (01:16:31.889)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:16:36.619)
Westman, Claire : "All right, I don't think." : (01:16:37.979)
Westman, Claire : "There's anything else here I need to attend to specifically?" : (01:16:42.219)
Westman, Claire : "Nothing seems." : (01:16:47.459)
Westman, Claire : "Oh yes you can." : (01:16:52.139)
Westman, Claire : "Under forms, without understanding the allegory of The" : (01:16:53.059)
Westman, Claire : "Cave, so the allegory of The Cave is just to" : (01:16:56.483)
Westman, Claire : "help you get an idea of." : (01:16:59.285)
Westman, Claire : "So that's Plato trying to explain." : (01:17:02.379)
Westman, Claire : "How he thinks that sort of knowledge works and our pursuit of knowledge works." : (01:17:05.979)
Westman, Claire : "So he provided the allegory of The Cave as a way to try and increase people's" : (01:17:10.779)
Westman, Claire : "understanding of how he believes we gain knowledge." : (01:17:17.643)
Westman, Claire : "So if you understand the forms without that, that's fine," : (01:17:22.849)
Westman, Claire : "but at some point you might be asked to explain a bit about." : (01:17:26.592)
Westman, Claire : "What the allegory of The Cave says, or to explain it." : (01:17:33.299)
Westman, Claire : "So there's not a huge discussion about it in the study guide." : (01:17:36.219)
Westman, Claire : "But just having an understanding of it can make it easier or can make it more" : (01:17:41.659)
Westman, Claire : "understandable for some people." : (01:17:45.981)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:17:52.139)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:18:01.039)
Westman, Claire : "Yes, the about waters H2O. How does Plato count for 9 facts like" : (01:18:01.319)
Westman, Claire : "that?" : (01:18:06.704)
Westman, Claire : "Because it seems like we have to have a theory of chemistry before we can know" : (01:18:07.119)
Westman, Claire : "that." : (01:18:10.881)
Westman, Claire : "But we can have a theory of chemistry prior to investigation of the world." : (01:18:11.119)
Westman, Claire : "Yeah, it's it's it gets a bit messy." : (01:18:15.079)
Westman, Claire : "And again, we need to remember that." : (01:18:18.919)
Westman, Claire : "Plato comes from a time in which." : (01:18:22.359)
Westman, Claire : "There wasn't." : (01:18:26.979)
Westman, Claire : "Yet." : (01:18:29.859)
Westman, Claire : "Scientific discovery as such." : (01:18:31.619)
Westman, Claire : "So if we think about how Aristotle was kind of, well," : (01:18:33.179)
Westman, Claire : "we had the the Malaysians who sort of started hinting at some scientific sort" : (01:18:38.431)
Westman, Claire : "of inquiry. But Plato, Aristotle is considered sort of the most." : (01:18:46.017)
Westman, Claire : "Prominent ancient Greek philosopher delving into sort of the scientific" : (01:18:52.529)
Westman, Claire : "method and scientific inquiry." : (01:18:58.571)
Westman, Claire : "So we need to remember also the time that they came from that there wasn't really." : (01:19:01.089)
Westman, Claire : "Such scientific inquiry as yet or scientific thinking as yet," : (01:19:08.899)
Westman, Claire : "and again this is some of the the critique of Plato that comes up that," : (01:19:13.447)
Westman, Claire : "you know, he kind of just makes these assumptions" : (01:19:18.730)
Westman, Claire : "or makes these." : (01:19:22.398)
Westman, Claire : "Claims about the forms and knowledge of the forms and these things existing and" : (01:19:24.409)
Westman, Claire : "so you can very much argue if you wanted to," : (01:19:31.187)
Westman, Claire : "that the idea that things only exist in our minds or for Plato like that," : (01:19:35.001)
Westman, Claire : "that knowledge only exists through our minds or beyond our mind." : (01:19:41.271)
Westman, Claire : "Is not." : (01:19:47.889)
Westman, Claire : "Really." : (01:19:49.499)
Westman, Claire : "Rational or plausible?" : (01:19:51.499)
Westman, Claire : "So for, you know, like I said, for you'll see with Aristotle," : (01:19:54.609)
Westman, Claire : "he has a different take on it and." : (01:19:58.303)
Westman, Claire : "The empiricists believe that we gain knowledge through experience and sense" : (01:20:02.489)
Westman, Claire : "experience, and we have to have those perceptions in" : (01:20:06.638)
Westman, Claire : "order to develop knowledge so." : (01:20:09.531)
Westman, Claire : "It's it's very, you know, again very good points and things that we" : (01:20:12.859)
Westman, Claire : "will get into more as we go through this for now." : (01:20:17.509)
Westman, Claire : "Remember you're going to give an overview of the idea of the forms you want to" : (01:20:20.928)
Westman, Claire : "explain that. For Plato, the form of the good was." : (01:20:26.331)
Westman, Claire : "The highest good." : (01:20:29.819)
Westman, Claire : "At the highest form that illuminated all the other forms in the pursuit of the" : (01:20:31.889)
Westman, Claire : "form of the good." : (01:20:36.662)
Westman, Claire : "We use our rationality and our reason, which are sort of our higher level." : (01:20:39.179)
Westman, Claire : "Human pursuit." : (01:20:48.169)
Westman, Claire : "It's through, you know, focusing on human desires and experience," : (01:20:49.129)
Westman, Claire : "sense experience that we sort of can give in to less virtuous things." : (01:20:55.884)
Westman, Claire : "So he thinks that if we're using our reason and our rationality and we're" : (01:21:03.209)
Westman, Claire : "pursuing knowledge of the good that we can live a virtuous life." : (01:21:08.469)
Westman, Claire : "So in that way virtue is dependent on knowledge." : (01:21:13.329)
Westman, Claire : "Because it's the pursuit of knowledge that." : (01:21:16.169)
Westman, Claire : "Allows us or gives us the tools to live a virtuous life." : (01:21:20.779)
Westman, Claire : "Gives us the the temperament, the characteristics," : (01:21:25.219)
Westman, Claire : "the character to live a virtuous life." : (01:21:28.909)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:21:32.099)
Westman, Claire : "So that's what you will need to focus on for question 3." : (01:21:32.299)
Westman, Claire : "Remember, it's 300 words, so you can't go wild." : (01:21:35.019)
Westman, Claire : "You can't include a whole lot, OK." : (01:21:38.063)
Westman, Claire : "Yes, of course." : (01:21:44.339)
Westman, Claire : "Yes, there's knowledge beyond the material" : (01:21:45.059)
Westman, Claire : "world and that's where Plato was working." : (01:21:47.065)
Westman, Claire : "There's both knowledge from experience and also in this in the real world," : (01:21:48.979)
Westman, Claire : "the place it talks about that does make absolute sense." : (01:21:53.421)
Westman, Claire : "But." : (01:21:58.379)
Westman, Claire : "Yes, there's a recording of the class, but for Plato he's a realist." : (01:22:01.719)
Westman, Claire : "So for him, the sensory experience is not important." : (01:22:05.999)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:22:11.119)
Westman, Claire : "So you will see that as we go through the module," : (01:22:11.599)
Westman, Claire : "there are other philosophers that say that yes, sensory experience is important." : (01:22:15.049)
Westman, Claire : "But we also have knowledge beyond the material world." : (01:22:22.139)
Westman, Claire : "Absolutely. OK. So." : (01:22:26.579)
Westman, Claire : "That absolutely makes sense." : (01:22:29.499)
Westman, Claire : "But he doesn't." : (01:22:31.649)
Westman, Claire : "Plato is not a person who thinks that." : (01:22:33.569)
Westman, Claire : "We should focus on sensory experience or that that's important." : (01:22:39.019)
Westman, Claire : "Remember, he wants us to sort of unburden ourselves" : (01:22:42.139)
Westman, Claire : "of that and focus on reason and rationality." : (01:22:45.055)
Westman, Claire : "So I know things I don't know because of ignorance." : (01:22:49.609)
Westman, Claire : "Of what's real." : (01:22:53.249)
Westman, Claire : "Basically, and it's also, it's also like you as you study," : (01:22:55.539)
Westman, Claire : "you're like, oh, OK." : (01:22:59.661)
Westman, Claire : "I know the things that I don't know." : (01:23:01.419)
Westman, Claire : "Because I know that I'm ignorant." : (01:23:05.059)
Westman, Claire : "So you'll you'll you'll start to sort of see that." : (01:23:07.059)
Westman, Claire : "So yes, it's it's sort of summed up like that. OK." : (01:23:10.579)
Westman, Claire : "I don't want to keep you much any longer. And I also." : (01:23:14.542)
Westman, Claire : "Left a." : (01:23:20.419)
Westman, Claire : "Symposium for this class. So I need to get back to that as well." : (01:23:21.049)
Westman, Claire : "So is there anything absolutely urgent that anyone needs to ask?" : (01:23:26.059)
Westman, Claire : "Before tomorrow." : (01:23:34.899)
Westman, Claire : "OK." : (01:23:40.399)
Westman, Claire : "Remember, I'm saying this one last time." : (01:23:41.679)
Westman, Claire : "You don't need to submit a page." : (01:23:44.559)
Westman, Claire : "That's an honestly declaration." : (01:23:47.399)
Westman, Claire : "There is a little box that you click when you click on assessment one." : (01:23:49.839)
Westman, Claire : "A box would come up." : (01:23:54.079)
Westman, Claire : "That you click." : (01:23:57.339)
Westman, Claire : "You can submit as PDF or word." : (01:23:59.459)
Westman, Claire : "You don't need a cover page or a contents page." : (01:24:04.979)
Westman, Claire : "You can have them if you want to." : (01:24:07.699)
Westman, Claire : "It's good practice to get to do them, but you don't have to." : (01:24:09.609)
Westman, Claire : "There is no specific format for the contents page or cover page." : (01:24:13.409)
Westman, Claire : "If you want to do them, just come up with your own format." : (01:24:17.581)
Westman, Claire : "Remember you submit on the system, so your name and student number is" : (01:24:22.899)
Westman, Claire : "already there." : (01:24:27.399)
Westman, Claire : "There is no turn it in for this assessment." : (01:24:28.299)
Westman, Claire : "Turn it in is only for the second assessment." : (01:24:31.739)
Westman, Claire : "Wait, hold on." : (01:24:38.459)
Westman, Claire : "Let me just check that before I continue." : (01:24:39.369)
Westman, Claire : "Sorry, I you know I've got." : (01:24:42.009)
Westman, Claire : "I've got a few modules." : (01:24:44.169)
Westman, Claire : "So let me just 100% check." : (01:24:47.499)
Westman, Claire : "But as far as I know, for this one no. So for this assessment," : (01:24:51.099)
Westman, Claire : "you're not using turnitin." : (01:24:56.054)
Westman, Claire : "So you don't need to worry about tuning in this time." : (01:25:04.069)
Westman, Claire : "You there are external plagiarism checkers you can use if you're concerned" : (01:25:08.229)
Westman, Claire : "about that." : (01:25:12.938)
Westman, Claire : "Sorry." : (01:25:15.139)
Westman, Claire : "But for the second assessment, there will be turnitin," : (01:25:17.259)
Westman, Claire : "OK and then turnitin is built into the system. So as soon as you submit," : (01:25:20.417)
Westman, Claire : "it will well not as soon as you submit and it goes through," : (01:25:24.608)
Westman, Claire : "turn it in and then you get your report. It can take somet." : (01:25:28.054)
Westman, Claire : "A few minutes it can take a few hours." : (01:25:31.499)
Westman, Claire : "To get your report." : (01:25:33.889)
Westman, Claire : "And I think that's the most important things I did send out an announcement" : (01:25:36.579)
Westman, Claire : "where I gave you an example of how to reference the study guide." : (01:25:40.201)
Westman, Claire : "Please also use tutorial letter 301." : (01:25:43.619)
Westman, Claire : "There's somebody's mark on." : (01:25:46.739)
Westman, Claire : "Yes." : (01:25:50.739)
Westman, Claire : "OK, then I'm going to leave it there for" : (01:25:53.049)
Westman, Claire : "today." : (01:25:56.050)
Westman, Claire : "Because we are almost at 2 hours." : (01:25:57.939)
Westman, Claire : "Thank you everybody for joining." : (01:26:00.859)
Westman, Claire : "Thank you for the discussions and the chats." : (01:26:02.499)
Westman, Claire : "I can see you putting thought into this and best of luck with finalising the" : (01:26:06.379)
Westman, Claire : "assignment." : (01:26:11.244)
Westman, Claire : "Please do not stress yourselves too much about it." : (01:26:12.059)
Westman, Claire : "I mean, I know it's scary to be doing this" : (01:26:16.419)
Westman, Claire : "assignment and it's different and." : (01:26:19.457)
Westman, Claire : "It's a lot of information." : (01:26:22.979)
Westman, Claire : "Ation to take in and it's complex, but please don't like make yourself super" : (01:26:24.129)
Westman, Claire : "stressed out or like sick over the assignment, OK?" : (01:26:29.783)
Westman, Claire : "You'll be OK all right." : (01:26:36.059)
Westman, Claire : "Do you remember?" : (01:26:38.379)
Westman, Claire : "We know your first your first semester." : (01:26:38.459)
Westman, Claire : "We do take that into consideration. I can see most of you are putting in a" : (01:26:40.499)
Westman, Claire : "lot of hard work. So please, please, please don't panic." : (01:26:44.703)
Westman, Claire : "Alright, thank you everybody for joining and good" : (01:26:48.219)
Westman, Claire : "luck with finalizing the assignment." : (01:26:52.009)
Westman, Claire : "And please make sure you submit before the deadline and don't wait until like" : (01:26:54.889)
Westman, Claire : "10:50 to submit tomorrow because the system might then give you hassles." : (01:27:00.137)
Westman, Claire : "So please submit when you can, today or tomorrow before the deadline." : (01:27:05.089)
Westman, Claire : "All right." : (01:27:10.329)
Westman, Claire : "And thank you again for attending." : (01:27:10.689)
Westman, Claire : "And I will chat to you next week if you have any questions," : (01:27:13.899)
Westman, Claire : "please send them to me." : (01:27:18.785)
Westman, Claire : "Do not send me questions." : (01:27:21.219)
Westman, Claire : "Also 10:50 tomorrow night." : (01:27:23.139)
Westman, Claire : "Will not be answering them at that stage, but if you have any questions now or" : (01:27:25.329)
Westman, Claire : "early tomorrow, I will try and get back to you as soon as" : (01:27:30.257)
Westman, Claire : "I can." : (01:27:33.874)
Westman, Claire : "OK, everyone." : (01:27:35.129)
