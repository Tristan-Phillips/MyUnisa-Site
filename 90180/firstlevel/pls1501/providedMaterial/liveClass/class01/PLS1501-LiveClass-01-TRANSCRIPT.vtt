00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:09.573
<v Westman, Claire>Modules,
so obviously our focus here is more on</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/92-1
00:00:09.573 --> 00:00:09.988
<v Westman, Claire>the.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/130-0
00:00:11.558 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Westman, Claire>Sort of beginnings of philosophy as we
know them today,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/130-1
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.749
<v Westman, Claire>which is what we're going to focus on in
this module,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/130-2
00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:22.083
<v Westman, Claire>and you'll see how a lot of what we learn
in this module ties into the other</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/130-3
00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:25.798
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy modules that you might be
doing now or that you might.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/148-0
00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:31.338
<v Westman, Claire>Do in second or third year or in honors
all of the sort of relates back to each</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/148-1
00:00:31.338 --> 00:00:31.748
<v Westman, Claire>other.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/189-0
00:00:31.748 --> 00:00:37.214
<v Westman, Claire>So this helps to give you a bit of a
foundation for where for the beginnings</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/189-1
00:00:37.214 --> 00:00:42.395
<v Westman, Claire>of philosophy as we know it today.
And obviously if you're doing African</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/189-2
00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:47.506
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy and you'll see in the
beginning of the study guide there's a</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/189-3
00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:51.268
<v Westman, Claire>lot of discussion around how Western
philosophy has.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/191-0
00:00:51.268 --> 00:00:51.628
<v Westman, Claire>Been.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/206-0
00:00:52.438 --> 00:00:57.866
<v Westman, Claire>Privileged throughout history,
and we've sort of as part of decolonizing</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/206-1
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.948
<v Westman, Claire>institutions moving towards.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/232-0
00:01:01.518 --> 00:01:07.314
<v Westman, Claire>Or making a concerted effort to bring in
more African philosophy and to move away</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/232-1
00:01:07.314 --> 00:01:10.918
<v Westman, Claire>from strictly only focusing on Western
philosophy.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/271-0
00:01:11.198 --> 00:01:17.829
<v Westman, Claire>But a lot of the theoretical frameworks
such as epistemology, metaphysics,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/271-1
00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.427
<v Westman, Claire>ontology,
they all sort of stem from the same place</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/271-2
00:01:22.427 --> 00:01:27.378
<v Westman, Claire>or from from what you're going to learn
in this module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/300-0
00:01:27.658 --> 00:01:32.728
<v Westman, Claire>And obviously they've changed and adapted
over, you know, throughout time,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/300-1
00:01:32.728 --> 00:01:37.528
<v Westman, Claire>but we're going to look at the the
foundations of, particularly Greek,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/300-2
00:01:37.528 --> 00:01:39.218
<v Westman, Claire>ancient Greek philosophy.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/321-0
00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:44.451
<v Westman, Claire>So you've already seen my face.
Some of you, for those who've just joined,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/321-1
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:49.338
<v Westman, Claire>let me just put my camera on for one
second so you can see me. That's me.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/325-0
00:01:49.538 --> 00:01:50.778
<v Westman, Claire>I'm doctor Claire westman.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/357-0
00:01:51.558 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Westman, Claire>So I am the module leader for the
semester and then we also have Mr.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/357-1
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.026
<v Westman, Claire>Kala Bopape, who's the lecturer.
He is in the meeting,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/357-2
00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:05.148
<v Westman, Claire>so if he wants to turn on his camera so
you can see him, he is welcome to.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/364-0
00:02:07.758 --> 00:02:10.478
<v Westman, Claire>But otherwise we'll load picture of him
as well.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/389-0
00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:16.433
<v Westman, Claire>And then for this module,
we also have a two markers who assist</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/389-1
00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:21.198
<v Westman, Claire>with the assessments and the exams
because this is a very large module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/410-0
00:02:21.598 --> 00:02:27.973
<v Westman, Claire>So we do have markers and then Mr.
Poppy and I also of course do marking and</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/410-1
00:02:27.973 --> 00:02:30.788
<v Westman, Claire>oversee the marking of the module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/455-0
00:02:31.268 --> 00:02:36.443
<v Westman, Claire>Please just note that in your tutorial
letter it lists Professor Monguini as the</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/455-1
00:02:36.443 --> 00:02:39.828
<v Westman, Claire>module leader,
but he's on sabbatical at the moment,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/455-2
00:02:39.828 --> 00:02:44.556
<v Westman, Claire>so I'm the acting module leader.
So if you have any questions or concerns</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/455-3

<v Westman, Claire>Mongrini he is.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/494-0
00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:55.727
<v Westman, Claire>He's on his research and development
leave,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/494-1
00:02:55.727 --> 00:02:58.827
<v Westman, Claire>so he is not working in the module at the
moment.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/494-2
00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:02.548
<v Westman, Claire>So please just take note of that if you
have any questions.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/504-0

<v Westman, Claire>He has been forwarding me some emails
from students who have been contacting</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/504-1
00:03:06.807 --> 00:03:07.028
<v Westman, Claire>him.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/517-0
00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:14.478
<v Westman, Claire>But all of our details are on the PLS1501
site.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/540-0
00:03:14.678 --> 00:03:19.419
<v Westman, Claire>So you can easily get in touch with us if
you need anything and a lot of students</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/540-1
00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.598
<v Westman, Claire>have already been contacting me through
the messaging.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/548-0
00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:25.278
<v Westman, Claire>Platform on my unisa.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/550-0
00:03:25.278 --> 00:03:26.078
<v Westman, Claire>That's great.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/552-0

00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:30.558
<v Westman, Claire>Or use that messaging platform.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/571-0
00:03:30.598 --> 00:03:33.518
<v Westman, Claire>Or use the relevant discussion forums.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/599-0
00:03:33.598 --> 00:03:38.825
<v Westman, Claire>We check them basically every day,
so if you have any concerns,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/599-1
00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:42.419
<v Westman, Claire>but obviously if it's more urgent
concerns,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/599-2
00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.728
<v Westman, Claire>please e-mail or use the messaging
functionality on my unisa OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/627-0
00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:52.757
<v Westman, Claire>So what is the purpose of PLS 1501 and
some of this is already in the tutorial</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/627-1
00:03:52.757 --> 00:03:55.813
<v Westman, Claire>letter,
so if you've worked through it then you</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/627-2
00:03:55.813 --> 00:03:58.168
<v Westman, Claire>might have already seen some of this.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/636-0
00:03:58.168 --> 00:04:01.128
<v Westman, Claire>But we're just going to have a bit of a
chat about it.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/664-0
00:04:01.368 --> 00:04:06.391
<v Westman, Claire>So obviously, as I've mentioned,
this module's purpose is specifically to</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/664-1
00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:11.888
<v Westman, Claire>introduce you to the history figures,
problems and themes in Western philosophy.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/703-0
00:04:11.888 --> 00:04:15.377
<v Westman, Claire>So again,
the focus is on Western philosophy,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/703-1
00:04:15.377 --> 00:04:21.142
<v Westman, Claire>whereas in other modules you might be
focusing on African philosophy and in</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/703-2
00:04:21.142 --> 00:04:24.858
<v Westman, Claire>particular in this module amongst other
figures,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/703-3
00:04:24.858 --> 00:04:30.319
<v Westman, Claire>we're going to look primarily at Socrates,
Plato, Aristotle, Augustine,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/703-4
00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:31.988
<v Westman, Claire>and Psalm and Aquinas.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/719-0
00:04:32.428 --> 00:04:37.394
<v Westman, Claire>You will see that they are also some
other philosophers mentioned in the early</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/719-1
00:04:37.394 --> 00:04:39.468
<v Westman, Claire>Greek ancient Greek philosophers.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/727-0
00:04:41.038 --> 00:04:42.558
<v Westman, Claire>But I'm not going to list all of them.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/750-0
00:04:42.798 --> 00:04:48.745
<v Westman, Claire>Make sure that you have read through the
study guide and have begun to work</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/750-1
00:04:48.745 --> 00:04:55.318
<v Westman, Claire>through that as you need to read through
that in order to complete your assignment.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/753-0
00:04:55.318 --> 00:04:57.198
<v Westman, Claire>So make sure that you please do that.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/799-0
00:04:58.758 --> 00:05:03.064
<v Westman, Claire>And also some of the main themes we're
going to look at and you'll get to know</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/799-1
00:05:03.064 --> 00:05:06.116
<v Westman, Claire>these terms better.
We won't focus on it too much today</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/799-2
00:05:06.116 --> 00:05:10.368
<v Westman, Claire>because this is just an introduction,
but some of the main themes we're going</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/799-3
00:05:10.368 --> 00:05:13.638
<v Westman, Claire>to focus on are epistemology, metaphysics,
political, Phil.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/804-0
00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:14.958
<v Westman, Claire>And ethics.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/852-0
00:05:15.438 --> 00:05:20.742
<v Westman, Claire>So we also want to help you develop an
awareness of philos philosophical issues</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/852-1
00:05:20.742 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Westman, Claire>in the academic environment, but also,
very importantly,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/852-2
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.558
<v Westman, Claire>is to help you develop critical skills
that you're going to use when you're</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/852-3
00:05:29.558 --> 00:05:34.265
<v Westman, Claire>studying philosophical arguments.
When you're evaluating philosophical</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/852-4
00:05:34.265 --> 00:05:34.928
<v Westman, Claire>arguments.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/874-0
00:05:34.928 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Westman, Claire>But then also thinking about how these
skills apply to real life situations in</v>

<v Westman, Claire>the world in which we live in your
communities, in your lives. So.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/887-0
00:05:47.198 --> 00:05:52.038
<v Westman, Claire>What's important is that you not think of
philosophy as just a subject.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/906-0
00:05:52.038 --> 00:05:56.658
<v Westman, Claire>That you're going to study here and never
use again and it's going to have no value</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/906-1
00:05:56.658 --> 00:05:58.308
<v Westman, Claire>for your studies or your life.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/949-0
00:05:58.548 --> 00:06:03.111
<v Westman, Claire>The skills and the reasoning abilities
that you're going to develop,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/949-1
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:08.334
<v Westman, Claire>the argumentation skills that you're
going to develop are very necessary parts</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/949-2
00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:11.839
<v Westman, Claire>of our lives,
and in reading through the reflections</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/949-3
00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:15.013
<v Westman, Claire>that some of you have done already on the
site,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/949-4
00:06:15.013 --> 00:06:17.988
<v Westman, Claire>I've seen some really good answers and
some.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/952-0
00:06:17.988 --> 00:06:18.428
<v Westman, Claire>Really.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/962-0
00:06:19.318 --> 00:06:23.228
<v Westman, Claire>Good thinking around what you already
know about philosophy.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/980-0
00:06:23.228 --> 00:06:28.502
<v Westman, Claire>So if you haven't done that already,
I mean it's just for you to do as a</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/980-1
00:06:28.502 --> 00:06:32.548
<v Westman, Claire>little extra exercise,
but it's a great way for you to.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/995-0
00:06:34.118 --> 00:06:36.918
<v Westman, Claire>Start the module to think about what do
you know about philosophy.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/998-0
00:06:37.118 --> 00:06:38.998
<v Westman, Claire>What does philosophy mean to you?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1007-0
00:06:39.118 --> 00:06:42.638
<v Westman, Claire>How is it going to help in your studies
in your life?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1057-0
00:06:42.638 --> 00:06:48.993
<v Westman, Claire>And I've seen some really great responses,
so I'm really excited to see that some of</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1057-1
00:06:48.993 --> 00:06:54.674
<v Westman, Claire>you already have an idea of what
philosophy is about, but more importantly,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1057-2
00:06:54.674 --> 00:06:59.982
<v Westman, Claire>how many of you have noted that
philosophy is an important part of our</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1057-3
00:06:59.982 --> 00:07:02.748
<v Westman, Claire>everyday lives? So we engage in Phil.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1076-0
00:07:02.908 --> 00:07:07.898
<v Westman, Claire>Thinking and philosophical reasoning
without even realizing that we're doing</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1076-1
00:07:07.898 --> 00:07:09.388
<v Westman, Claire>it most of the time so.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1089-0
00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.735
<v Westman, Claire>Every day we engage in philosophical
thought without knowing that you're doing</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1089-1
00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:14.878
<v Westman, Claire>it.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1110-0
00:07:15.078 --> 00:07:18.813
<v Westman, Claire>And then once we once you've been doing
philosophy for a bit of time,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1110-1
00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:22.548
<v Westman, Claire>once you've done this module while you're
working through the module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1144-0
00:07:24.118 --> 00:07:29.138
<v Westman, Claire>Those critical thinking and reasoning
skills are going to develop even further,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1144-1
00:07:29.138 --> 00:07:33.906
<v Westman, Claire>and you're going to gain a greater
awareness of how valuable philosophy and</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1144-2
00:07:33.906 --> 00:07:36.918
<v Westman, Claire>philosophical thinking is in everything
you do.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1153-0
00:07:36.918 --> 00:07:40.758
<v Westman, Claire>So it involves.
Why do we make the choices we make?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1160-0
00:07:40.838 --> 00:07:43.198
<v Westman, Claire>Why do we have the beliefs that we have?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1166-0
00:07:43.398 --> 00:07:45.798
<v Westman, Claire>How do you gain knowledge of the world?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1174-0
00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.358
<v Westman, Claire>How can you understand the world and
others better?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1179-0
00:07:49.718 --> 00:07:51.558
<v Westman, Claire>What is your place in the world?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1187-0
00:07:53.148 --> 00:07:55.948
<v Westman, Claire>And these might seem like a very big
questions.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1192-0
00:07:57.878 --> 00:07:58.518
<v Westman, Claire>And they can be.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1197-0
00:07:58.518 --> 00:07:58.838
<v Westman, Claire>And often you will.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1207-0
00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:02.318
<v Westman, Claire>You'll never might not ever get an
specific answer to them.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1217-0
00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:06.118
<v Westman, Claire>But the point is to be reflective to
think about these things.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1247-0
00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:11.228
<v Westman, Claire>It's so important because very often we
make choices or we have beliefs,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1247-1
00:08:11.228 --> 00:08:16.758
<v Westman, Claire>but we don't really think about why we
make those choices or why we have those</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1247-2
00:08:16.758 --> 00:08:19.838
<v Westman, Claire>beliefs or why we do the things that we
do.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1256-0
00:08:20.518 --> 00:08:27.228
<v Westman, Claire>And so philosophy fee is about think is
about developing that reflective nature.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1261-0
00:08:28.798 --> 00:08:29.998
<v Westman, Claire>That helps us to.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1302-0
00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:37.530
<v Westman, Claire>Be more intentional about our thoughts
and be more conscious of those choices we</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1302-1
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:43.381
<v Westman, Claire>make and of those decisions and of the
ways we are in the world and the kinds of</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1302-2
00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:48.438
<v Westman, Claire>things we the way we gain knowledge,
the way we understand the world.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1335-0
00:08:48.718 --> 00:08:54.035
<v Westman, Claire>So you will see that the big questions
and a lot of the times as you're doing</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1335-1
00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:57.647
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy,
sometimes you will see that your beliefs</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1335-2
00:08:57.647 --> 00:09:02.964
<v Westman, Claire>and your opinions and your ideas and the
way you think about yourself and the</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1335-3
00:09:02.964 --> 00:09:06.508
<v Westman, Claire>world and others can start to change.
And that's a.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1360-0
00:09:06.508 --> 00:09:11.672
<v Westman, Claire>Good thing we all need to be reflective
of who we are and how we behave and how</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1360-1
00:09:11.672 --> 00:09:15.415
<v Westman, Claire>we act in this world,
so hopefully that is something that</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1360-2
00:09:15.415 --> 00:09:17.868
<v Westman, Claire>you're going to gain from this module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1371-0
00:09:18.878 --> 00:09:24.268
<v Westman, Claire>So philosophy can help to guide our well
us to think about the questions.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1405-0
00:09:25.838 --> 00:09:30.417
<v Westman, Claire>That guide our lives that can help us to
think about the ways or reflect on the</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1405-1
00:09:30.417 --> 00:09:35.054
<v Westman, Claire>ways in which we interact with others,
the kinds of meaning we assign to our own</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1405-2
00:09:35.054 --> 00:09:39.518
<v Westman, Claire>lives and the way in which we view not
only our place in the world, but also.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1418-0
00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:42.598
<v Westman, Claire>The value and meaning to be assigned to
the world around us.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1443-0
00:09:42.598 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Westman, Claire>So here you might even think about the
meanings and value you assigned to</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1443-1
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.831
<v Westman, Claire>animals or to nature and the way you
interact with that and the way you exist</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1443-2
00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:53.908
<v Westman, Claire>in the world so.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1467-0
00:09:55.478 --> 00:09:58.805
<v Westman, Claire>They're very,
very big concept and big questions and</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1467-1
00:09:58.805 --> 00:10:03.198
<v Westman, Claire>conflicts very complex at times and they
can challenge your thinking.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1470-0
00:10:03.588 --> 00:10:05.548
<v Westman, Claire>They can challenge the way.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1505-0
00:10:07.238 --> 00:10:10.352
<v Westman, Claire>You feel about others the way you think
about yourselves,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1505-1
00:10:10.352 --> 00:10:14.592
<v Westman, Claire>about the meaning of your own life,
but that is the whole point of philosophy,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1505-2
00:10:14.592 --> 00:10:18.994
<v Westman, Claire>and that is what I hope that you're going
to start to develop as you work through</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1505-3
00:10:18.994 --> 00:10:19.638
<v Westman, Claire>this module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1538-0
00:10:21.318 --> 00:10:23.994
<v Westman, Claire>So yeah,
I'm really glad that some of a lot of you</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1538-1
00:10:23.994 --> 00:10:27.930
<v Westman, Claire>have already done the reflections.
It's given me a good insight into where</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1538-2
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.866
<v Westman, Claire>you are at this point and what you
already know and what you already think</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1538-3
00:10:31.866 --> 00:10:32.758
<v Westman, Claire>about philosophy.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1557-0
00:10:33.148 --> 00:10:37.235
<v Westman, Claire>Thank you for everyone that has done that.
So specifically in this module,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1557-1
00:10:37.235 --> 00:10:40.068
<v Westman, Claire>these are some of the questions we're
going to ask.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1558-0
00:10:40.268 --> 00:10:41.308
<v Westman, Claire>What can we know?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1564-0
00:10:41.588 --> 00:10:43.308
<v Westman, Claire>How do we gain knowledge?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1587-0
00:10:43.308 --> 00:10:47.731
<v Westman, Claire>So for example,
some philosophers say that we knowledge</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1587-1
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:51.839
<v Westman, Claire>is only gained through rationality or
using reason.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1587-2
00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:55.788
<v Westman, Claire>Aristotle would say that it's through
experience.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1591-0
00:10:56.108 --> 00:10:57.988
<v Westman, Claire>So how do we get that knowledge?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1608-0
00:10:58.798 --> 00:11:01.677
<v Westman, Claire>Then we're also going to ask things like
in terms of ethics,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1608-1
00:11:01.677 --> 00:11:03.518
<v Westman, Claire>how do we know what is right and wrong?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1613-0
00:11:03.908 --> 00:11:06.188
<v Westman, Claire>How do we make decisions about that?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1621-0
00:11:07.838 --> 00:11:08.918
<v Westman, Claire>What is justice?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1625-0
00:11:09.078 --> 00:11:10.838
<v Westman, Claire>What form of government is best?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1632-0
00:11:10.838 --> 00:11:13.758
<v Westman, Claire>What does it mean to be a social animal?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1643-0
00:11:13.758 --> 00:11:17.558
<v Westman, Claire>So what does it mean to be a person in a
social setting?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1652-0
00:11:17.638 --> 00:11:22.038
<v Westman, Claire>What does it mean to live in a world with
others with nature, with?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1666-0
00:11:23.838 --> 00:11:27.683
<v Westman, Claire>You know, with animals, with ancestors,
what does it just mean to be a person in</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1666-1
00:11:27.683 --> 00:11:28.158
<v Westman, Claire>the world?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1707-0
00:11:28.478 --> 00:11:33.615
<v Westman, Claire>So these are some of the main questions
that we're going to ask as we work</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1707-1
00:11:33.615 --> 00:11:39.025
<v Westman, Claire>through this module and I hope as I said
that it's going to stimulate your own</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1707-2
00:11:39.025 --> 00:11:43.409
<v Westman, Claire>thoughts and you're going to see how this
relates to your life,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1707-3
00:11:43.409 --> 00:11:46.148
<v Westman, Claire>to your everyday experiences, the quest.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1718-0
00:11:46.388 --> 00:11:49.994
<v Westman, Claire>You have about the world, about your life,
about others,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1718-1
00:11:49.994 --> 00:11:51.828
<v Westman, Claire>and about how you are living.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1762-0
00:11:54.388 --> 00:11:57.247
<v Westman, Claire>So the main outcomes,
as we've already said,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1762-1
00:11:57.247 --> 00:12:02.013
<v Westman, Claire>obviously one of the most important
things that we need you to want you to</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1762-2
00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:06.905
<v Westman, Claire>achieve by the end of the module is to
understand the theoretical frameworks</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1762-3
00:12:06.905 --> 00:12:11.416
<v Westman, Claire>that we will be looking at,
such as epistemology, metaphysics, ethics,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1762-4
00:12:11.416 --> 00:12:11.988
<v Westman, Claire>etcetera.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1783-0
00:12:13.918 --> 00:12:16.688
<v Westman, Claire>And very, very very importantly,
as a student,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1783-1
00:12:16.688 --> 00:12:21.226
<v Westman, Claire>as a person in the world is to develop
those critical thinking and reasoning</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1783-2
00:12:21.226 --> 00:12:21.638
<v Westman, Claire>skills.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1826-0
00:12:22.638 --> 00:12:27.119
<v Westman, Claire>Then by the end of the module,
you will hopefully have enhanced your</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1826-1
00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:30.172
<v Westman, Claire>skills for developing philosophical
arguments,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1826-2
00:12:30.172 --> 00:12:35.368
<v Westman, Claire>considering counter arguments and not
just looking at one side of the argument.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1826-3
00:12:35.368 --> 00:12:40.563
<v Westman, Claire>But it's always important to consider
what the other side of the argument might</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1826-4
00:12:40.563 --> 00:12:40.758
<v Westman, Claire>be.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1836-0
00:12:40.758 --> 00:12:47.078
<v Westman, Claire>What might other people say about this
idea or notion? How do these?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1842-0
00:12:48.278 --> 00:12:49.558
<v Westman, Claire>Interact with each other.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1874-0
00:12:49.558 --> 00:12:53.459
<v Westman, Claire>What are the strengths and weaknesses of
different arguments,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1874-1
00:12:53.459 --> 00:12:57.989
<v Westman, Claire>and how does that help you to reach a
conclusion or to develop your own</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1874-2
00:12:57.989 --> 00:13:02.708
<v Westman, Claire>argument and then obviously as you go
through the module, you're going to?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1909-0
00:13:04.598 --> 00:13:09.778
<v Westman, Claire>Begin to understand and develop more
complex arguments of your own by drawing</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1909-1
00:13:09.778 --> 00:13:14.360
<v Westman, Claire>on those theoretical frameworks by
drawing on research and doing the</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1909-2
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.078
<v Westman, Claire>readings throughout the module throughout
the semester.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1927-0
00:13:18.888 --> 00:13:24.044
<v Westman, Claire>So that is what the main things that we
hope you're going to be able to achieve</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1927-1
00:13:24.044 --> 00:13:27.008
<v Westman, Claire>by the time we reach the end of the
semester.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1951-0
00:13:27.368 --> 00:13:32.113
<v Westman, Claire>So in order to do that,
it will be based on your readings on the</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1951-1
00:13:32.113 --> 00:13:37.953
<v Westman, Claire>assignments that we give you on engaging
in those discussion forums on thinking</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1951-2
00:13:37.953 --> 00:13:39.048
<v Westman, Claire>about the work.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1956-0
00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:43.408
<v Westman, Claire>So philosophy can be challenging.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1970-0
00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:47.278
<v Westman, Claire>And I won't sugarcoat that it can be a
challenging subject.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/1977-0
00:13:47.598 --> 00:13:50.908
<v Westman, Claire>It's a different way of reading,
a different way of thinking.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2017-0
00:13:52.478 --> 00:13:55.898
<v Westman, Claire>So a different way of writing a time so
it can be complex,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2017-1
00:13:55.898 --> 00:14:00.362
<v Westman, Claire>but I don't want you to go into this
being scared of the module and thinking</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2017-2
00:14:00.362 --> 00:14:04.941
<v Westman, Claire>it's something that's so out there and
something that you've never engaged in.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2017-3
00:14:04.941 --> 00:14:07.318
<v Westman, Claire>Like I said, it's something you do every.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2025-0
00:14:07.318 --> 00:14:09.478
<v Westman, Claire>Day you just don't know that you do.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2039-0
00:14:09.798 --> 00:14:14.183
<v Westman, Claire>And obviously when you're doing
philosophy at university,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2039-1
00:14:14.183 --> 00:14:17.358
<v Westman, Claire>it is more formal and you need to rely on.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2060-0
00:14:18.518 --> 00:14:22.749
<v Westman, Claire>The text that you read,
I'm doing research and developing your</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2060-1
00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:26.308
<v Westman, Claire>arguments based on referenced and
reasoned evidence.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2084-0
00:14:28.838 --> 00:14:32.945
<v Westman, Claire>But it is something that you can do and
we see that every year people do,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2084-1
00:14:32.945 --> 00:14:35.497
<v Westman, Claire>you know,
we come up with good arguments that</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2084-2
00:14:35.497 --> 00:14:36.718
<v Westman, Claire>understand the theory.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2126-0
00:14:36.718 --> 00:14:40.907
<v Westman, Claire>So I don't want you to go into the module
feeling overwhelmed,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2126-1
00:14:40.907 --> 00:14:46.160
<v Westman, Claire>which can happen with philosophy and
obviously we are here to help you through</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2126-2
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.750
<v Westman, Claire>the semester,
so please don't ever feel worried about</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2126-3
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:55.136
<v Westman, Claire>reaching out or concerned about posting
on the forums that maybe people will you</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2126-4
00:14:55.136 --> 00:14:55.468
<v Westman, Claire>know.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2133-0
00:14:55.508 --> 00:14:56.948
<v Westman, Claire>Think it's a silly question.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2169-0
00:14:57.748 --> 00:15:01.960
<v Westman, Claire>I can assure you any questions that you
have somebody else in the module,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2169-1
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:06.002
<v Westman, Claire>somebody else is also doing.
The module has and they will be very glad</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2169-2
00:15:06.002 --> 00:15:09.588
<v Westman, Claire>that you've asked the question so that
they can also find out.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2180-0
00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:13.788
<v Westman, Claire>So please don't ever be afraid to reach
out or to ask US questions.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2195-0
00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:16.965
<v Westman, Claire>That is, the point is,
we are here to help you,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2195-1
00:15:16.965 --> 00:15:21.068
<v Westman, Claire>to get through this module and to
hopefully enjoy the module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2216-0
00:15:21.068 --> 00:15:27.531
<v Westman, Claire>That's the main goal and to help you
develop an interest or philosophy and to</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2216-1
00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:30.348
<v Westman, Claire>want to continue on in philosophy.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2222-0
00:15:30.348 --> 00:15:33.628
<v Westman, Claire>So please always reach out if you need us.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2236-0
00:15:35.308 --> 00:15:40.680
<v Westman, Claire>So the prescribed books and reading there
is no prescribed book for this module as</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2236-1
00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.068

<v Westman, Claire>through the tutorial letter already.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2289-0
00:15:47.878 --> 00:15:51.883
<v Westman, Claire>The main source for this module is the
study guide,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2289-1
00:15:51.883 --> 00:15:57.121

00:15:57.121 --> 00:16:02.821
<v Westman, Claire>it's under the official study material
link on the PLS 150125 S One site,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2289-3
00:16:02.821 --> 00:16:05.748

00:16:05.948 --> 00:16:11.045
<v Westman, Claire>If you haven't already looked at it
because you do need to read through that,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2320-1
00:16:11.045 --> 00:16:16.207
<v Westman, Claire>at least the some of the units in order
to answer the questions for assessment</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2320-2
00:16:16.207 --> 00:16:16.468
<v Westman, Claire>one.</v>

00:16:18.038 --> 00:16:21.208
<v Westman, Claire>So for your assessments and to prepare
for the exam,</v>

00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:24.198
<v Westman, Claire>you will use the study guide as your main
source.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2355-0
00:16:24.558 --> 00:16:30.282
<v Westman, Claire>But because you are now at university,
we also expect you to do some of your own</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2355-1
00:16:30.282 --> 00:16:30.918
<v Westman, Claire>research.</v>

<v Westman, Claire>Please make sure you focus focus on the
study guide,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2394-1
00:16:36.698 --> 00:16:39.424
<v Westman, Claire>but do your own research if possible as
well,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2394-2
00:16:39.424 --> 00:16:43.038
<v Westman, Claire>because that is something that you need
to start developing.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2394-3
00:16:43.038 --> 00:16:47.837
<v Westman, Claire>Those skills you need to start thinking
about what other sources say you need to</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2394-4
00:16:47.837 --> 00:16:50.148
<v Westman, Claire>start bringing research into your work.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2412-0
00:16:51.798 --> 00:16:56.375
<v Westman, Claire>So other than those,
the other resources that you will use are</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2412-1
00:16:56.375 --> 00:16:58.118
<v Westman, Claire>the tutorial letter 101.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2429-0
00:16:58.438 --> 00:17:03.077
<v Westman, Claire>That obviously if you have looked at it
already contains important administrative</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2429-1
00:17:03.077 --> 00:17:04.718
<v Westman, Claire>information about the module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2448-0
00:17:05.028 --> 00:17:09.858
<v Westman, Claire>It gives you an overview of the module,
so it's very important to go through that</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2448-1
00:17:09.858 --> 00:17:12.508
<v Westman, Claire>to just have an understanding of the
module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2472-0
00:17:12.908 --> 00:17:17.505
<v Westman, Claire>Then you will also find on the site
tutorial letter 301 and this is also a</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2472-1
00:17:17.505 --> 00:17:21.428
<v Westman, Claire>very important resource for when you're
doing your assessments.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2496-0
00:17:23.238 --> 00:17:28.392
<v Westman, Claire>This tutorial letter gives you guidelines
for writing a philosophical essay and</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2496-1
00:17:28.392 --> 00:17:30.518
<v Westman, Claire>very importantly for referencing.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2504-0
00:17:31.118 --> 00:17:36.468
<v Westman, Claire>So remember that referencing is
absolutely vital.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2522-0
00:17:37.028 --> 00:17:42.060
<v Westman, Claire>Any assessment you submit in philosophy
and in most other modules,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2522-1
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.388
<v Westman, Claire>but I want to speak for others.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2534-0
00:17:44.628 --> 00:17:50.334
<v Westman, Claire>But any assessment you submit in
philosophy has to include referenced</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2534-1
00:17:50.334 --> 00:17:51.068
<v Westman, Claire>evidence.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2553-0
00:17:51.068 --> 00:17:57.768
<v Westman, Claire>So you need to have an idea of how to
reference so that tutorial letter gives</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2553-1
00:17:57.768 --> 00:18:01.548
<v Westman, Claire>you gives explanations of how to
reference.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2559-0
00:18:02.318 --> 00:18:03.568
<v Westman, Claire>In your work OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2564-0
00:18:03.568 --> 00:18:06.088
<v Westman, Claire>So very, very, very, very important.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2579-0
00:18:07.638 --> 00:18:11.198
<v Westman, Claire>Then you also will get tutorial letters
2:01 and 2:02.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2597-0
00:18:11.558 --> 00:18:15.590
<v Westman, Claire>Those are not on the site yet,
because those are the follow up tutorial</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2597-1
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.158
<v Westman, Claire>letters for the assessments.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2603-0
00:18:17.358 --> 00:18:20.678
<v Westman, Claire>So those act in a way as a kind of memo.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2651-0
00:18:22.358 --> 00:18:27.185
<v Westman, Claire>Giving you guidelines for what should
have been included in the assessments,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2651-1
00:18:27.185 --> 00:18:30.132
<v Westman, Claire>how you could have approached the
assessments,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2651-2
00:18:30.132 --> 00:18:35.272
<v Westman, Claire>the kind of thing that we were looking
for when we were marking your assessments,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2651-3
00:18:35.272 --> 00:18:40.288
<v Westman, Claire>they won't give you exact answers because
in philosophy they are an issue doing</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2651-4
00:18:40.288 --> 00:18:41.228
<v Westman, Claire>critical, Phil.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2657-0
00:18:41.388 --> 00:18:42.348
<v Westman, Claire>A critical reasoning.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2662-0
00:18:42.348 --> 00:18:45.148
<v Westman, Claire>They are very specific answers,
but in this module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2685-0
00:18:46.718 --> 00:18:51.293
<v Westman, Claire>They aren't right or wrong answers.
The important point is that you</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2685-1
00:18:51.293 --> 00:18:56.878
<v Westman, Claire>understand the theory that you are able
to explain the theory comprehensively and.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2704-0
00:19:01.598 --> 00:19:07.220
<v Westman, Claire>In a way that explain the theory properly
and that you are able to develop an</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2704-1
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:07.868
<v Westman, Claire>argument.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2717-0
00:19:07.868 --> 00:19:13.472
<v Westman, Claire>So if we ask you, for example,
who do you agree with more Plato or</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2717-1
00:19:13.472 --> 00:19:14.308
<v Westman, Claire>Aristotle?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2731-0
00:19:15.878 --> 00:19:18.998
<v Westman, Claire>Neither of those. If you said Plato,
or if you said Aristotle.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2737-0
00:19:18.998 --> 00:19:21.198
<v Westman, Claire>Neither of those answers are right or
wrong.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2744-0
00:19:21.358 --> 00:19:24.038
<v Westman, Claire>What we want to see is why you say that.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2752-0
00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:26.598
<v Westman, Claire>How you support that answer?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2779-0
00:19:26.598 --> 00:19:31.556
<v Westman, Claire>How you develop your argument,
how you make it clear why you are saying</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2779-1
00:19:31.556 --> 00:19:35.894
<v Westman, Claire>that you, for example,
agree with Plato's theory off the forms</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2779-2
00:19:35.894 --> 00:19:38.028
<v Westman, Claire>rather than with Aristotle, OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2813-0
00:19:38.028 --> 00:19:43.695
<v Westman, Claire>So you will never get one straightforward
answer to the questions that are in your</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2813-1
00:19:43.695 --> 00:19:47.040
<v Westman, Claire>assessments in those follow up tutorial
letters.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2813-2
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.956
<v Westman, Claire>There will be guidelines of how you could
have approached the question.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2813-3
00:19:51.956 --> 00:19:55.028
<v Westman, Claire>The primary things that we were looking
for.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2833-0
00:19:56.598 --> 00:20:02.065
<v Westman, Claire>And how you could have drawn on that
information and then closer to the exam,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2833-1
00:20:02.065 --> 00:20:04.518
<v Westman, Claire>we will load some past exam papers.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2856-0
00:20:05.828 --> 00:20:09.748
<v Westman, Claire>Again,
these are just to help you and see what</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2856-1
00:20:09.748 --> 00:20:16.588
<v Westman, Claire>kinds of questions might be asked in the
exams. The way questions might be asked.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2874-0
00:20:18.158 --> 00:20:22.042
<v Westman, Claire>Obviously that's not going to be the
exact same questions in your exam,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2874-1
00:20:22.042 --> 00:20:24.038
<v Westman, Claire>but just to give you an idea of what.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2899-0
00:20:24.038 --> 00:20:27.479
<v Westman, Claire>A question what the questions are like in
a philosophy exam,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2899-1
00:20:27.479 --> 00:20:32.105
<v Westman, Claire>and once you see that then you can start
to also think about how you will prepare</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2899-2
00:20:32.105 --> 00:20:32.838
<v Westman, Claire>for the exam.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2902-0
00:20:32.878 --> 00:20:34.838
<v Westman, Claire>So those will be loaded.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2907-0
00:20:36.668 --> 00:20:37.348
<v Westman, Claire>Not right now.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2914-0
00:20:37.348 --> 00:20:39.948
<v Westman, Claire>Because for now,
we need you to focus on your assessments.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2929-0
00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:43.587
<v Westman, Claire>So a little bit later in the semester,
we will load those so that you can start</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2929-1
00:20:43.587 --> 00:20:44.588
<v Westman, Claire>working through those.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2940-0
00:20:47.308 --> 00:20:51.428
<v Westman, Claire>So then for this module,
there are three assessments.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2983-0
00:20:51.428 --> 00:20:56.928
<v Westman, Claire>There are two assignments and one exam,
so you might have already seen this</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2983-1
00:20:56.928 --> 00:21:01.921
<v Westman, Claire>information or do some of it in the
tutorial letter and on the site,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/2983-2
00:21:01.921 --> 00:21:07.348
<v Westman, Claire>and these are the kinds of assessments
when they do and the semester wait.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3000-0
00:21:07.748 --> 00:21:11.283
<v Westman, Claire>So assessment one,
you know a short answer questions.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3000-1
00:21:11.283 --> 00:21:14.948
<v Westman, Claire>The due date is the 20th of March and it
is out of 100.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3022-0
00:21:15.758 --> 00:21:23.256
<v Westman, Claire>So what the semester wait means is that
this assignment assessment 1 counts 20%</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3022-1
00:21:23.256 --> 00:21:26.068
<v Westman, Claire>of your overall semester mark.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3047-0
00:21:26.468 --> 00:21:34.401
<v Westman, Claire>So assessment one and assessment 2
together count 40% of your total semester</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3047-1
00:21:34.401 --> 00:21:37.388
<v Westman, Claire>mark and your exam count 60%.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3072-0
00:21:38.958 --> 00:21:42.877
<v Westman, Claire>So that's not something you need to worry
about too much.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3072-1
00:21:42.877 --> 00:21:48.417
<v Westman, Claire>It's just showing you that the exam has a
slightly greater waiting than the other</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3072-2
00:21:48.417 --> 00:21:49.228
<v Westman, Claire>assessments.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3083-0
00:21:49.428 --> 00:21:52.508
<v Westman, Claire>But it's it's not something you really
need to be stressed about.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3101-0
00:21:52.988 --> 00:21:56.259
<v Westman, Claire>Just do your assessments as best as you
can.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3101-1
00:21:56.259 --> 00:22:00.548
<v Westman, Claire>Make sure that you submit assessment one
and assessment 2.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3103-0
00:22:00.908 --> 00:22:03.068
<v Westman, Claire>Both are mandatory for this module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3128-0
00:22:04.638 --> 00:22:11.867
<v Westman, Claire>So and if you submit only one of them,
then you are likely not to do very well</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3128-1
00:22:11.867 --> 00:22:17.358
<v Westman, Claire>overall in the semester.
It will affect your overall grade.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3149-0
00:22:17.948 --> 00:22:24.153
<v Westman, Claire>So it is mandatory that you do assessment
one and two assessment 2 which is due on</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3149-1
00:22:24.153 --> 00:22:27.068
<v Westman, Claire>the 25th of April is an essay question.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3172-0
00:22:28.638 --> 00:22:32.194
<v Westman, Claire>And again,
it's out of 100 and waiting of 20% and</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3172-1
00:22:32.194 --> 00:22:36.318
<v Westman, Claire>then the exam will consist of short
answers and an essay.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3202-0
00:22:36.318 --> 00:22:41.477
<v Westman, Claire>So it will combine the kinds of questions
you've been asked in assessment one and</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3202-1
00:22:41.477 --> 00:22:46.259
<v Westman, Claire>assessment two and we can't give you the
date for that yet because the exam</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3202-2
00:22:46.259 --> 00:22:49.908
<v Westman, Claire>timetable is not out yet,
but it is in May or June, yeah.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3234-0
00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:54.571
<v Westman, Claire>So I've already received some questions
about assessment one and I don't want to</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3234-1
00:22:54.571 --> 00:22:58.661
<v Westman, Claire>go into too much detail about it now,
but just to address the ones that I've</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3234-2
00:22:58.661 --> 00:23:00.308
<v Westman, Claire>received a few questions about.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3248-0
00:23:01.878 --> 00:23:04.598
<v Westman, Claire>One question was do you need
introductions and conclusions?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3257-0
00:23:04.598 --> 00:23:07.398
<v Westman, Claire>It states very clearly in the assessment.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3267-0
00:23:07.438 --> 00:23:13.038
<v Westman, Claire>Instructions do not include introductions
or conclusions for assessment.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3276-0
00:23:13.038 --> 00:23:15.878
<v Westman, Claire>One they are short answer questions.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3312-0
00:23:16.198 --> 00:23:21.321
<v Westman, Claire>Each question has a word limit of 300
words, which might seem like a lot,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3312-1
00:23:21.321 --> 00:23:25.059
<v Westman, Claire>but it is not.
So if you including in an introduction</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3312-2
00:23:25.059 --> 00:23:30.321
<v Westman, Claire>and a conclusion in those 300 words,
you're not really going to have enough</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3312-3
00:23:30.321 --> 00:23:33.228
<v Westman, Claire>space to get to the most important inform.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3322-0
00:23:34.468 --> 00:23:38.748
<v Westman, Claire>So for assessment one,
you just have to include.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3334-0
00:23:40.318 --> 00:23:42.878
<v Westman, Claire>The what we would call the body of the
answer, OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3367-0
00:23:42.878 --> 00:23:47.570
<v Westman, Claire>So just include the most important
information that's needed to answer the</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3367-1
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:52.387
<v Westman, Claire>question that's needed to help you
develop your discussion or your argument,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3367-2
00:23:52.387 --> 00:23:57.141
<v Westman, Claire>depending on what the question is.
You do not need to include introductions</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3367-3
00:23:57.141 --> 00:23:59.268
<v Westman, Claire>or conclusions for assessment one.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3381-0
00:24:00.838 --> 00:24:04.918
<v Westman, Claire>Then I've had quite a few people emailing
me about if they need a cover page.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3390-0
00:24:06.598 --> 00:24:08.598
<v Westman, Claire>It is not compulsory to include a cover
page.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3415-0
00:24:08.598 --> 00:24:13.291
<v Westman, Claire>There's no mark for it,
but it is good to get into the habit of</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3415-1
00:24:13.291 --> 00:24:17.471
<v Westman, Claire>doing cover pages,
so you are welcome to include a cover</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3415-2
00:24:17.471 --> 00:24:20.918
<v Westman, Claire>page,
but you won't be penalized if you don't.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3439-0
00:24:22.468 --> 00:24:26.617
<v Westman, Claire>The same with the contents page.
If you want to include a contents page,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3439-1
00:24:26.617 --> 00:24:30.026
<v Westman, Claire>you're welcome to,
but you will not lose marks if you don't</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3439-2
00:24:30.026 --> 00:24:30.708
<v Westman, Claire>include one.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3449-0
00:24:32.278 --> 00:24:35.558
<v Westman, Claire>Then people have asked me about the the
font.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3465-0
00:24:35.878 --> 00:24:40.798
<v Westman, Claire>So you can use one of the more academic
fronts. One of the more formal fonts.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3479-0
00:24:40.798 --> 00:24:46.159
<v Westman, Claire>So Calibri,
aerial or times new Roman and I would</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3479-1
00:24:46.159 --> 00:24:48.518
<v Westman, Claire>suggest size 11 or 12.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3492-0
00:24:51.988 --> 00:24:56.016
<v Westman, Claire>Hard and fast rules about it,
but size 10 can be difficult for us to</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3492-1
00:24:56.016 --> 00:24:56.308
<v Westman, Claire>read.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3526-0
00:24:57.878 --> 00:25:03.637
<v Westman, Claire>If you have challenges with your eyesight
and you need to type in bigger font,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3526-1
00:25:03.637 --> 00:25:08.814
<v Westman, Claire>then please do so absolutely,
but otherwise stick to around size 11 or</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3526-2
00:25:08.814 --> 00:25:11.438
<v Westman, Claire>12 and then again with line spacing.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3545-0
00:25:11.878 --> 00:25:16.706
<v Westman, Claire>There are no specific rules about it,
but it is easier for us to read when</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3545-1
00:25:16.706 --> 00:25:20.118
<v Westman, Claire>we're marking.
If your line spacing is 1 1/2 or two.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3565-0
00:25:20.118 --> 00:25:23.785
<v Westman, Claire>Even so,
those are just some of the general</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3565-1
00:25:23.785 --> 00:25:28.868
<v Westman, Claire>guidelines for the more technical aspects
of the assignment.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3573-0
00:25:29.188 --> 00:25:31.548
<v Westman, Claire>Very, very important for the assignment.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3580-0
00:25:31.788 --> 00:25:36.068
<v Westman, Claire>Remember to include your in text
referencing and a bibliography.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3600-0
00:25:37.598 --> 00:25:39.974
<v Westman, Claire>OK,
so that is something that you must</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3600-1
00:25:39.974 --> 00:25:43.082
<v Westman, Claire>include,
but I'm not going to focus on the content</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3600-2
00:25:43.082 --> 00:25:44.788

<v Westman, Claire>very beneficial are the online databases.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3790-0
00:26:45.598 --> 00:26:51.008
<v Westman, Claire>These are very convenient and reliable
way to access academic articles.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3790-1
00:26:51.008 --> 00:26:57.018
<v Westman, Claire>I'm sure a lot of you don't know how to
use the online databases at this stage.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3790-2

<v Westman, Claire>databases are probably the easiest way
for you to go about finding good academic</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3831-3

<v Westman, Claire>And articles and so when you go onto the
databases once you know how to use them,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/3873-1
00:27:36.242 --> 00:27:40.350
<v Westman, Claire>it's a really,

00:27:56.575 --> 00:28:00.908
<v Westman, Claire>You will need to know how to use slides.
So if you don't already know.</v>

00:29:44.638 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Westman, Claire>Do not wait until the last minute, though.
Sometimes what happens is because</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4161-1
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:54.078

00:29:54.078 --> 00:29:59.616
<v Westman, Claire>During 11 the system crashes or you have
technical challenges and then you don't</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4177-1

<v Westman, Claire>Unless you have a very, very valid reason,

00:30:15.788 --> 00:30:20.751
<v Westman, Claire>And that would have severely impacted on
you submitting.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4228-1
00:30:20.751 --> 00:30:24.583
<v Westman, Claire>We do not accept assignments by e-mail,
OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4228-2
00:30:24.583 --> 00:30:30.068
<v Westman, Claire>So you must make sure that you submit in
time so that you can.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4238-0
00:30:32.718 --> 00:30:36.358
<v Westman, Claire>Contact us if there are any challenges
that you face or that you can.</v>

00:30:38.038 --> 00:30:42.288
<v Westman, Claire>Submit, try again and submit again.
If the system is down or anything like</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4260-1
00:30:42.288 --> 00:30:44.895
<v Westman, Claire>that. OK,
we know that there can be technical</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4260-2
00:30:44.895 --> 00:30:45.518
<v Westman, Claire>challenges.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4288-0
00:30:45.518 --> 00:30:50.436
<v Westman, Claire>We know in this country issues with
network and load shedding,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4288-1
00:30:50.436 --> 00:30:54.807
<v Westman, Claire>but your assignments are given to you
while in advance,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4288-2
00:30:54.807 --> 00:30:58.788
<v Westman, Claire>so they shouldn't really be any technical
excuses.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4302-0
00:30:59.468 --> 00:31:04.948
<v Westman, Claire>So generally we see those when people are
trying to submit their watch, says 1058.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4312-0
00:31:04.948 --> 00:31:09.588
<v Westman, Claire>But on the system it's 11/01 and the
submission has closed OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4322-0
00:31:09.588 --> 00:31:13.428
<v Westman, Claire>So please do not wait until the very last
minute.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4326-0
00:31:14.148 --> 00:31:16.548
<v Westman, Claire>So my suggestion is always try and submit.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4363-0
00:31:17.358 --> 00:31:21.954
<v Westman, Claire>At least a day or two in advance,
in case there are any challenges.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4363-1
00:31:21.954 --> 00:31:26.077
<v Westman, Claire>If you can't do that,
try at least submit a few hours before</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4363-2
00:31:26.077 --> 00:31:29.592
<v Westman, Claire>the deadline. OK,
so for for both your assessments,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4363-3
00:31:29.592 --> 00:31:34.188
<v Westman, Claire>the deadline is 11 at night,
but try and submit in advance of that.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4402-0
00:31:35.758 --> 00:31:40.610
<v Westman, Claire>OK. And if you have challenges,
please let us know as it says in the last</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4402-1
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:45.461
<v Westman, Claire>point, as soon as you possibly can,
because if you come to us three weeks</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4402-2
00:31:45.461 --> 00:31:50.312
<v Westman, Claire>later and say I couldn't submit
assessment one because of whatever reason</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4402-3
00:31:50.312 --> 00:31:52.148
<v Westman, Claire>it might be too late for us.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4425-0
00:31:52.148 --> 00:31:56.372
<v Westman, Claire>To do anything about it,
remember there are cut off dates as well</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4425-1
00:31:56.372 --> 00:31:59.508
<v Westman, Claire>for us to submit marks to the to the

00:32:02.558 --> 00:32:06.604
<v Westman, Claire>They are processes that we have to follow
behind the scenes that sometimes mean</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4446-1
00:32:06.604 --> 00:32:08.678

00:32:30.476 --> 00:32:35.524
<v Westman, Claire>introductions because it's very difficult
to get to know you when we are in this</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4524-2
00:32:35.524 --> 00:32:36.708

<v Westman, Claire>So the introductions are one way that I
can get to know you that the other people</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4542-1

00:33:17.478 --> 00:33:21.964
<v Westman, Claire>We might need to assist with what areas
need more attention,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4652-1

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4720-1
00:33:53.263 --> 00:33:56.028
<v Westman, Claire>be looking at the content of the module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4730-0
00:33:56.468 --> 00:34:00.668
<v Westman, Claire>Please prepare in advance by reading
through the relevant section.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4745-0
00:34:00.668 --> 00:34:05.188
<v Westman, Claire>That or relevant material that we will be
focusing on in the discussion session.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4764-0
00:34:05.998 --> 00:34:10.441
<v Westman, Claire>In those discussion classes,
I will not be repeating everything that's</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4764-1
00:34:10.441 --> 00:34:12.068
<v Westman, Claire>in the study guide, right?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4783-0
00:34:12.068 --> 00:34:14.558
<v Westman, Claire>Because the study guide is there for you
to read it,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4783-1
00:34:14.558 --> 00:34:18.268
<v Westman, Claire>so I'm not going to just repeat what's in
there. That would be boring for you.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4785-0
00:34:18.268 --> 00:34:20.028
<v Westman, Claire>It would not be super helpful.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4794-0
00:34:21.598 --> 00:34:23.118
<v Westman, Claire>There will be an overview of the unit.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4830-0
00:34:23.158 --> 00:34:28.005
<v Westman, Claire>There will be an overview of the content,
but much more importantly,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4830-1
00:34:28.005 --> 00:34:33.625
<v Westman, Claire>there a chance for you to ask questions
about the content to gain clarification</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4830-2
00:34:33.625 --> 00:34:38.964
<v Westman, Claire>on anything that is unclear to you.
Their chance for us to engage with each</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4830-3
00:34:38.964 --> 00:34:42.828
<v Westman, Claire>other for you to develop a deeper
understanding stand.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4862-0
00:34:42.828 --> 00:34:46.503
<v Westman, Claire>Off the content.
So if you attend the discussion class and</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4862-1
00:34:46.503 --> 00:34:51.050
<v Westman, Claire>you haven't read anything and you have no
idea what we're talking about,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4862-2
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:55.348
<v Westman, Claire>they will not be as beneficial for you as
if you prepare in advance.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4881-0
00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:59.313
<v Westman, Claire>Because if you already have some kind of
idea of what we're talking about,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4881-1
00:34:59.313 --> 00:35:02.388
<v Westman, Claire>you'll be able to focus more during the
discussion session.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4889-0
00:35:02.508 --> 00:35:05.908
<v Westman, Claire>You'll be able to think about what you've
been reading.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4910-0
00:35:06.068 --> 00:35:09.386
<v Westman, Claire>You will have the questions that you're
concerned about,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4910-1
00:35:09.386 --> 00:35:12.121
<v Westman, Claire>all the areas that need clarification for
you,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4910-2
00:35:12.121 --> 00:35:15.148
<v Westman, Claire>so please do prepare in advance for those
sessions.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4914-0
00:35:16.718 --> 00:35:17.878
<v Westman, Claire>And then finally.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4946-0
00:35:19.478 --> 00:35:25.250
<v Westman, Claire>Are there any expectations that you have
for the module or that you have for</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4946-1
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:29.598
<v Westman, Claire>either me or for me and Mr. Popapi,
as the PLS 1501 team?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4984-0
00:35:29.838 --> 00:35:34.701
<v Westman, Claire>Are there any things that in particular
that you are hoping to gain from this or</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4984-1
00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:39.324
<v Westman, Claire>that you hope you know we can help you
with or that you expect from us while</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4984-2
00:35:39.324 --> 00:35:44.248
<v Westman, Claire>you're going through the module or do you
have any other questions or concerns as</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4984-3
00:35:44.248 --> 00:35:45.148
<v Westman, Claire>you're getting?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4989-0
00:35:45.148 --> 00:35:46.108
<v Westman, Claire>Started with the module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/4996-0
00:35:46.308 --> 00:35:48.788
<v Westman, Claire>If you do,
you can put up your hand and ask them.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5012-0
00:35:48.788 --> 00:35:54.063
<v Westman, Claire>You can pop them in the chat.
Anything that you are at this stage</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5012-1
00:35:54.063 --> 00:35:58.378
<v Westman, Claire>concerned about any questions you have at
this stage.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5019-0
00:36:01.778 --> 00:36:03.974
<v Westman, Claire>OK,
while you're thinking and writing in the</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5019-1
00:36:03.974 --> 00:36:04.218
<v Westman, Claire>chat.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5022-0
00:36:05.718 --> 00:36:06.358
<v Westman, Claire>I will just say.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5052-0
00:36:08.838 --> 00:36:13.899
<v Westman, Claire>With regards to the assessments,
we often get emails from students saying</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5052-1
00:36:13.899 --> 00:36:18.207
<v Westman, Claire>I haven't got my marks.
My friend has got these or when are we</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5052-2
00:36:18.207 --> 00:36:19.438
<v Westman, Claire>getting our marks?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5056-0
00:36:19.558 --> 00:36:21.398
<v Westman, Claire>So just so that you have an idea.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5073-0
00:36:23.678 --> 00:36:29.226
<v Westman, Claire>The average turn around time or the time
that we are given is between 2 weeks and</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5073-1
00:36:29.226 --> 00:36:30.038
<v Westman, Claire>three weeks.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5103-0
00:36:30.828 --> 00:36:35.702
<v Westman, Claire>So we aim very much to have your marks
back to you within that time,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5103-1
00:36:35.702 --> 00:36:39.587
<v Westman, Claire>two to three weeks,
but sometimes remember, as I said,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5103-2
00:36:39.587 --> 00:36:41.988
<v Westman, Claire>there's four of us who do marking.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5108-0
00:36:42.188 --> 00:36:46.548
<v Westman, Claire>So one of your friends might have their
marks done.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5137-0
00:36:48.118 --> 00:36:51.408
<v Westman, Claire>Before it might get their assignment back
before you,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5137-1
00:36:51.408 --> 00:36:56.222
<v Westman, Claire>but if it goes past three weeks and you
don't have your mark or everybody else</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5137-2
00:36:56.222 --> 00:36:59.878
<v Westman, Claire>has theirs and you haven't seen yours,
or there's an issue.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5143-0
00:37:00.508 --> 00:37:02.548
<v Westman, Claire>Then please contact us, K.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5147-0
00:37:05.038 --> 00:37:05.318
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5158-0
00:37:05.318 --> 00:37:09.478
<v Westman, Claire>So I'm seeing a lot of questions here,
so let me go through them.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5166-0
00:37:11.198 --> 00:37:12.558
<v Westman, Claire>Help understanding Palmer needles.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5177-0
00:37:12.558 --> 00:37:15.769
<v Westman, Claire>Please,
we will focus on that in next week's</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5177-1
00:37:15.769 --> 00:37:17.838
<v Westman, Claire>session if that is OK, Dylan.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5183-0
00:37:19.678 --> 00:37:21.678
<v Westman, Claire>We'll have class once a week.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5190-0
00:37:21.758 --> 00:37:24.478
<v Westman, Claire>It won't always be a teams meeting.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5193-0
00:37:24.478 --> 00:37:26.638
<v Westman, Claire>Some weeks I will just load.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5204-0
00:37:28.358 --> 00:37:32.908
<v Westman, Claire>Pre recorded lessons or reading material
for you.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5221-0
00:37:33.308 --> 00:37:38.321
<v Westman, Claire>So it won't always be an in person class,
but in general it will be once a week and</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5221-1
00:37:38.321 --> 00:37:40.708
<v Westman, Claire>it will be at this time every Wednesday.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5240-0
00:37:42.278 --> 00:37:46.554
<v Westman, Claire>This seems to be a fairly good time since
there are about 85 of you here,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5240-1
00:37:46.554 --> 00:37:49.558
<v Westman, Claire>which is a very high turn out,
so that's fantastic.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5251-0
00:37:51.238 --> 00:37:54.238
<v Westman, Claire>How can you submit your assignment OK?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5266-0
00:37:54.238 --> 00:37:57.668
<v Westman, Claire>I'll very quickly once I've gone through
the questions,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5266-1
00:37:57.668 --> 00:38:02.628
<v Westman, Claire>share my screen to show you where you
find the assignment and how you submit it.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5270-0
00:38:05.508 --> 00:38:06.388
<v Westman, Claire>Tristan asks.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5294-0
00:38:06.388 --> 00:38:11.269
<v Westman, Claire>Are there any specific YouTube channels
or videos or other material for extra</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5294-1
00:38:11.269 --> 00:38:16.462
<v Westman, Claire>info about philosophy and in general and
just a fun listen or watch off the top of</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5294-2
00:38:16.462 --> 00:38:17.588
<v Westman, Claire>my head right now?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5306-0
00:38:19.878 --> 00:38:25.438
<v Westman, Claire>I can't think of specific ones,
but I will put a little list on.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5308-0
00:38:27.078 --> 00:38:27.638
<v Westman, Claire>The site.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5320-0
00:38:29.358 --> 00:38:32.798
<v Westman, Claire>I'm currently listening to.
It's called a life well lived.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5325-0
00:38:34.148 --> 00:38:35.388
<v Westman, Claire>It's a podcast.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5341-0
00:38:35.508 --> 00:38:43.308
<v Westman, Claire>I found it on Spotify and it is hosted by
Peter Singer who is a very renowned</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5341-1
00:38:43.308 --> 00:38:44.508
<v Westman, Claire>philosopher.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5376-0
00:38:46.078 --> 00:38:50.024
<v Westman, Claire>He's particularly works in animal ethics
and utilitarianism,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5376-1
00:38:50.024 --> 00:38:53.194
<v Westman, Claire>so not exactly what you're doing in this
module,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5376-2
00:38:53.194 --> 00:38:57.982
<v Westman, Claire>but it is a very interesting podcast he
hosted with another with a Polish</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5376-3
00:38:57.982 --> 00:38:58.758
<v Westman, Claire>philosopher.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5398-0
00:38:58.758 --> 00:39:06.383
<v Westman, Claire>She does work around hedonism and they
interviewing all kinds of people from</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5398-1
00:39:06.383 --> 00:39:10.938
<v Westman, Claire>various sort of industries and walks of
life.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5405-0
00:39:10.938 --> 00:39:14.618
<v Westman, Claire>So the one I'm listening to at the moment
is with a historian.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5406-0
00:39:14.898 --> 00:39:15.618
<v Westman, Claire>Very interesting.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5422-0
00:39:15.618 --> 00:39:20.348
<v Westman, Claire>That also have people on like Jane
Goodall, the person who founded Peter,</v>

00:39:20.348 --> 00:39:21.818
<v Westman, Claire>the Peter Organization.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5425-0
00:39:22.058 --> 00:39:24.098
<v Westman, Claire>So that one's called a laugh.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5428-0
00:39:24.098 --> 00:39:24.818
<v Westman, Claire>Well lived.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5430-0
00:39:24.818 --> 00:39:27.058
<v Westman, Claire>It talks a lot about.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5436-0
00:39:27.918 --> 00:39:29.398
<v Westman, Claire>What makes a good laugh?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5446-0
00:39:29.518 --> 00:39:32.798
<v Westman, Claire>Which are some of the things that you'll
be sort of considering in this module?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5453-0
00:39:33.188 --> 00:39:34.788
<v Westman, Claire>What does it mean to live a good life?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5458-0
00:39:34.788 --> 00:39:36.268
<v Westman, Claire>How can we live with others?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5459-0
00:39:36.268 --> 00:39:37.628
<v Westman, Claire>How can we improve?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5466-0
00:39:37.868 --> 00:39:39.068
<v Westman, Claire>Sort of the world around us.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5469-0
00:39:39.068 --> 00:39:40.228
<v Westman, Claire>So that's a great one.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5474-0
00:39:41.798 --> 00:39:42.918
<v Westman, Claire>And it's not too complex.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5488-0
00:39:42.918 --> 00:39:47.479
<v Westman, Claire>So that would be a good one to listen to,
but otherwise I'll have a look for some</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5488-1
00:39:47.479 --> 00:39:48.758
<v Westman, Claire>others for you as well.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5495-0
00:39:50.478 --> 00:39:51.198
<v Westman, Claire>Turn it in.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5509-0
00:39:51.198 --> 00:39:56.290
<v Westman, Claire>We will look closer at the time,
but Turnitin is built into the my Unisa</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5509-1
00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:56.918
<v Westman, Claire>platform.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5531-0
00:39:57.238 --> 00:40:02.978
<v Westman, Claire>So when you submit your assignment on the
in the normal assessment two submission</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5531-1
00:40:02.978 --> 00:40:06.268
<v Westman, Claire>area,
it will automatically be sent to turn it</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5531-2
00:40:06.268 --> 00:40:09.348
<v Westman, Claire>in OK and you will get three
opportunities.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5538-0
00:40:10.918 --> 00:40:11.798
<v Westman, Claire>To submit it.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5560-0
00:40:11.798 --> 00:40:15.815
<v Westman, Claire>So if you submit the first time and
realize, Oh no, we oh,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5560-1
00:40:15.815 --> 00:40:20.308
<v Westman, Claire>I didn't realize that I'd used AI to
write this whole assignment.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5577-0
00:40:20.378 --> 00:40:24.651
<v Westman, Claire>And now my whole thing's plagiarized,
which would be a very odd thing,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5577-1
00:40:24.651 --> 00:40:27.178
<v Westman, Claire>because you would know that you'd used AI.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5594-0
00:40:27.178 --> 00:40:33.814
<v Westman, Claire>But if for some reason it happens that
you get a very high turnitin result,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5594-1
00:40:33.814 --> 00:40:35.298
<v Westman, Claire>you can resubmit.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5605-0
00:40:36.868 --> 00:40:39.948
<v Westman, Claire>But I don't want to go too much into
turnitin in now.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5613-0
00:40:39.988 --> 00:40:43.228
<v Westman, Claire>But I know this is a question that I get
all the time.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5625-0
00:40:43.428 --> 00:40:46.708
<v Westman, Claire>What is an acceptable percentage on
turnitin?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5627-0
00:40:47.708 --> 00:40:49.268
<v Westman, Claire>It's very difficult to say.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5645-0
00:40:51.178 --> 00:40:57.418
<v Westman, Claire>Because we look at the more of the detail
of the report rather than the percentage.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5659-0
00:40:57.418 --> 00:41:01.688
<v Westman, Claire>So if you know you have paraphrased so
you've written in your own words,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5659-1
00:41:01.688 --> 00:41:03.618
<v Westman, Claire>you've included your referencing.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5683-0
00:41:03.818 --> 00:41:08.479
<v Westman, Claire>You haven't used AI to do your answer,
even if it's a higher percentage,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5683-1
00:41:08.479 --> 00:41:12.947
<v Westman, Claire>you don't need to panic. OK,
as long as you know you've done what you</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5683-2
00:41:12.947 --> 00:41:13.458
<v Westman, Claire>need to.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5687-0
00:41:13.698 --> 00:41:15.698
<v Westman, Claire>That's all you have to worry about.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5704-0
00:41:16.708 --> 00:41:19.223
<v Westman, Claire>The unique codes they are there in the
instructions,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5704-1
00:41:19.223 --> 00:41:20.788
<v Westman, Claire>but you don't actually need them.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5726-0
00:41:20.788 --> 00:41:24.214
<v Westman, Claire>That was,
we say that you need to know the unique</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5726-1
00:41:24.214 --> 00:41:27.435
<v Westman, Claire>code,
but that was more for when you did paper</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5726-2
00:41:27.435 --> 00:41:28.668
<v Westman, Claire>based submissions.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5734-0
00:41:28.868 --> 00:41:31.948
<v Westman, Claire>Now obviously the submissions just come
directly to us.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5748-0
00:41:31.948 --> 00:41:35.668
<v Westman, Claire>So you don't need to worry too much,
but they are on the instructions.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5751-0
00:41:35.668 --> 00:41:36.908
<v Westman, Claire>I'll show you when we go there.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5770-0
00:41:38.628 --> 00:41:43.620
<v Westman, Claire>I have not started a WhatsApp group for
the module because there are concerns</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5770-1
00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:46.308
<v Westman, Claire>around the protection of your information.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5789-0
00:41:46.948 --> 00:41:52.248
<v Westman, Claire>You are very welcome to start a WhatsApp
group for the module and you're welcome</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5789-1
00:41:52.248 --> 00:41:53.818
<v Westman, Claire>to add me to that group.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5817-0
00:41:53.818 --> 00:42:00.260
<v Westman, Claire>So I'll put my number here if you want to
add me to the WhatsApp group,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5817-1
00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:07.418
<v Westman, Claire>but there are some concerns around Poppy.
If we start the group and add you so.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5823-0
00:42:08.988 --> 00:42:09.348
<v Westman, Claire>Or you join.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5837-0
00:42:09.348 --> 00:42:15.272
<v Westman, Claire>So I suggest that one of your students
start the WhatsApp group and we can take</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5837-1
00:42:15.272 --> 00:42:16.308
<v Westman, Claire>it from there.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5854-0
00:42:16.308 --> 00:42:23.466
<v Westman, Claire>I will put a WhatsApp discussion forum
and you can discuss there about joining</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5854-1
00:42:23.466 --> 00:42:25.188
<v Westman, Claire>the WhatsApp group.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5870-0
00:42:29.098 --> 00:42:31.542
<v Westman, Claire>OK. No,
on the assignment we have to write each</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5870-1
00:42:31.542 --> 00:42:32.458
<v Westman, Claire>question as essay.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5874-0
00:42:32.458 --> 00:42:33.818
<v Westman, Claire>No, I've discussed that.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5883-0
00:42:33.898 --> 00:42:38.418
<v Westman, Claire>You don't have to write each.
You answer each question you say 1.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5894-0
00:42:39.988 --> 00:42:41.908
<v Westman, Claire>So you've got question one, you answer it.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5901-0
00:42:41.908 --> 00:42:44.788
<v Westman, Claire>You don't have to have an introduction
and conclusion.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5909-0
00:42:44.948 --> 00:42:46.508
<v Westman, Claire>It is not a proper essay.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5919-0
00:42:46.508 --> 00:42:50.988
<v Westman, Claire>It is short answer questions so you don't
include an introduction.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5923-0
00:42:50.988 --> 00:42:52.388
<v Westman, Claire>Don't include a conclusion.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5939-0
00:42:52.428 --> 00:42:57.126
<v Westman, Claire>You're just going to give us the most
important information and develop an</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5939-1
00:42:57.126 --> 00:43:00.258
<v Westman, Claire>argument,
develop a discussion for each question.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5942-0
00:43:04.798 --> 00:43:05.278
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5966-0
00:43:05.958 --> 00:43:09.795
<v Westman, Claire>How the concept of philosophical thinking,
epistemology, logic, metaphysics,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5966-1
00:43:09.795 --> 00:43:11.987
<v Westman, Claire>having context with Western philosophy?
OK,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5966-2
00:43:11.987 --> 00:43:14.678
<v Westman, Claire>those are all things we're going to do in
the module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5972-0
00:43:14.758 --> 00:43:16.638
<v Westman, Claire>So I'm not going to get into that now.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5978-0
00:43:16.638 --> 00:43:17.918
<v Westman, Claire>It's a great question.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5979-0
00:43:17.918 --> 00:43:18.998
<v Westman, Claire>Thank you, Elton.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5995-0
00:43:19.158 --> 00:43:22.195
<v Westman, Claire>But that is sort of the core of the
module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/5995-1
00:43:22.195 --> 00:43:26.198
<v Westman, Claire>So we'll be working on those as we go
through the module.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6004-0
00:43:27.828 --> 00:43:32.028
<v Westman, Claire>Yes, favour asks.
Is Google a reliable a Google Scholar?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6008-0
00:43:32.028 --> 00:43:32.788
<v Westman, Claire>Reliable source.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6023-0
00:43:33.618 --> 00:43:36.510
<v Westman, Claire>Yes,
Google Scholar is a very reliable source,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6023-1
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:40.018
<v Westman, Claire>so that is something that you can use for
your research.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6041-0
00:43:41.588 --> 00:43:47.380
<v Westman, Claire>The only problem with Google Scholar is
that sometimes you will find an article</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6041-1
00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.828
<v Westman, Claire>that sounds amazing.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6044-0
00:43:48.828 --> 00:43:49.588
<v Westman, Claire>It's perfect.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6055-0
00:43:49.588 --> 00:43:53.348
<v Westman, Claire>It's exactly what you need and all you
can see is the abstract.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6090-0
00:43:53.348 --> 00:43:58.142
<v Westman, Claire>So all you can see is a summary of the

you to pay to access the.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6090-2
00:44:02.207 --> 00:44:06.818
<v Westman, Claire>It'll take you to to the journal site and
the journal will want you to pay.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6118-0
00:44:06.818 --> 00:44:11.424
<v Westman, Claire>For the article that's just that's very
normal journal practice,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6118-1
00:44:11.424 --> 00:44:16.455
<v Westman, Claire>but it means that it's been very
difficult for you to sometimes access</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6118-2
00:44:16.455 --> 00:44:20.778
<v Westman, Claire>those articles and that is why we have
the online databases.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6134-0
00:44:20.898 --> 00:44:23.993
<v Westman, Claire>So I will in the little video I'm going
to do,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6134-1
00:44:23.993 --> 00:44:28.338
<v Westman, Claire>I will show you how you can use Google

00:44:29.148 --> 00:44:32.450
<v Westman, Claire>When you use Google Scholar,
if there's only an abstract,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6160-1
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:36.890
<v Westman, Claire>you can search for that source on the
online databases or that article on the</v>

00:44:39.428 --> 00:44:42.816
<v Westman, Claire>If the full text is not available on
Google Scholar very often,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6187-1
00:44:42.816 --> 00:44:46.309
<v Westman, Claire>the full text is available on Google
Scholar, but not always. OK,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6187-2
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:49.379
<v Westman, Claire>but it's of good source,
and that's a very good question.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6187-3
00:44:49.379 --> 00:44:49.908

<v Westman, Claire>Another place that you can sometimes find
good articles is on a place called</v>

00:45:00.428 --> 00:45:05.713
<v Westman, Claire>So sometimes I've put the thing in the
name in the comments.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6221-1
00:45:05.713 --> 00:45:09.958
<v Westman, Claire>Sometimes people will load to the

<v Westman, Claire>And sometimes.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6249-0
00:45:18.668 --> 00:45:24.948
<v Westman, Claire>They you can e-mail them even and ask
them to send you the article.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6254-0
00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:26.868
<v Westman, Claire>So that's another place that you can look.</v>

00:45:28.588 --> 00:45:32.255
<v Westman, Claire>OK,
I understand referencing is very tricky</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6280-1
00:45:32.255 --> 00:45:38.921

<v Westman, Claire>but we can talk about it a little bit
next week because we're running out of</v>

00:46:06.178 --> 00:46:12.446
<v Westman, Claire>We know that you might not reference

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6356-1
00:46:12.446 --> 00:46:15.778
<v Westman, Claire>is that you are attempting to reference K.</v>

00:46:17.548 --> 00:46:19.188
<v Westman, Claire>Do you reference at the end OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6377-0
00:46:19.508 --> 00:46:22.108
<v Westman, Claire>I've just got a notification that I've

<v Westman, Claire>Do you write references after each

00:46:30.171 --> 00:46:34.046
<v Westman, Claire>everything?
So in text referencing you do in your</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6402-2
00:46:34.046 --> 00:46:34.588
<v Westman, Claire>answer.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6411-0
00:46:35.378 --> 00:46:39.378
<v Westman, Claire>So where you use the information you
include the reference.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6459-0
00:46:39.738 --> 00:46:45.723
<v Westman, Claire>So if I write a sentence saying Plato
says that all we see on Earth are</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6459-1
00:46:45.723 --> 00:46:50.378
<v Westman, Claire>imitations of the form,
I would put my reference there.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6459-2
00:46:50.378 --> 00:46:54.618
<v Westman, Claire>Then I'd carry on my next sentence
explaining. OK,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6459-3
00:46:54.618 --> 00:46:59.938

00:47:00.748 --> 00:47:04.597
<v Westman, Claire>Which is in your answer.
And then there's a bibliography that goes</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/6497-0
00:47:15.468 --> 00:47:18.828

00:48:11.188 --> 00:48:14.920

00:55:39.828 --> 00:55:42.954
<v Westman, Claire>OK,
so in general you should paraphrase</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7390-0
00:55:40.218 --> 00:55:40.298

00:55:42.954 --> 00:55:49.205
<v Westman, Claire>because that shows us that you understand
it helps for making your writing more</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7407-2
00:55:49.205 --> 00:55:49.908
<v Westman, Claire>cohesive.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7420-0
00:55:50.108 --> 00:55:53.548
<v Westman, Claire>But remember, even when you paraphrase,
it's not your idea.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7427-0
00:55:54.108 --> 00:55:56.028
<v Westman, Claire>So you need to include a reference.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7442-0
00:55:56.028 --> 00:56:00.269
<v Westman, Claire>So always think to yourself,
if it's not your words or if it's not</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7442-1
00:56:00.269 --> 00:56:02.548

00:56:02.868 --> 00:56:06.668
<v Westman, Claire>So even if you've taken someone else's
idea, like from the study guide.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7457-0
00:56:07.418 --> 00:56:08.698
<v Westman, Claire>And you write it in your own words.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7463-0
00:56:09.088 --> 00:56:12.408

so I will put those.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7484-0

00:56:25.018 --> 00:56:28.938
<v Westman, Claire>That's when you use the exact words that
are in, for example the study guide.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7509-0
00:56:31.098 --> 00:56:35.218

marks.</v>

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:29.058
<v N VAN DER SCHYFF>I wanted to.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7693-0
00:58:29.258 --> 00:58:33.098
<v N VAN DER SCHYFF>I wanted to know when referencing so we
got the three questions.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7711-0
00:58:33.338 --> 00:58:35.667
<v N VAN DER SCHYFF>So when referencing,
let's say to question one,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7711-1
00:58:35.667 --> 00:58:37.898
<v N VAN DER SCHYFF>can you add it in the middle of the
question?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7726-0
00:58:37.898 --> 00:58:41.217
<v N VAN DER SCHYFF>So like when you quote the sentence,
can you add the referencing while you</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7726-1
00:58:41.217 --> 00:58:42.058
<v N VAN DER SCHYFF>quote the sentence?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7730-0
00:58:42.058 --> 00:58:44.098
<v N VAN DER SCHYFF>Or must you make A at the end like?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7735-0
00:58:44.908 --> 00:58:45.948
<v Westman, Claire>No, no, you must put it.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7760-0
00:58:45.948 --> 00:58:50.028
<v Westman, Claire>Yeah, so you if you quote,
you put the reference directly after the</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7760-1
00:58:50.028 --> 00:58:52.848
<v Westman, Claire>quote.
So you put the reference where you have</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7760-2
00:58:52.848 --> 00:58:54.348

00:58:54.348 --> 00:58:58.502
<v Westman, Claire>So a lot of students will end up putting
a reference right at the end of the</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7779-1
00:58:58.502 --> 00:59:02.548

00:59:04.628 --> 00:59:07.828

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7916-0
01:00:08.728 --> 01:00:10.528
<v Klaas Mampa>I'll, I'll continue, OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7919-0
01:00:10.488 --> 01:00:10.728
<v Anam GXEKWA>Replay.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7922-0
01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:12.438
<v Klaas Mampa>Yeah, I was saying.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7923-0
01:00:12.838 --> 01:00:13.278
<v Klaas Mampa>Could you?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7929-0
01:00:13.278 --> 01:00:16.558
<v Klaas Mampa>Could more than a sentence in that case,
what will happen?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7963-0
01:00:19.128 --> 01:00:24.271
<v Westman, Claire>I mean, we'll still read it,
but if you're quoting a whole paragraph</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7963-1
01:00:24.271 --> 01:00:29.787
<v Westman, Claire>in a in an answer of 300 words,
that's a whole chunk of the work where we</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7963-2
01:00:29.787 --> 01:00:32.768
<v Westman, Claire>can't see if you actually understand it.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/7978-0
01:00:34.198 --> 01:00:39.798
<v Westman, Claire>Or if you're just sticking a paragraph
quote in, because to fill up a space.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8011-0
01:00:40.118 --> 01:00:45.589
<v Westman, Claire>So when you get to higher levels of study,
you can include entire paragraphs</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8011-1
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:50.988
<v Westman, Claire>sometimes or longer quotes because you're
submitting much longer documents.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8011-2
01:00:50.988 --> 01:00:55.748
<v Westman, Claire>But at first year level,
where the document where your answers are</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8011-3
01:00:55.748 --> 01:00:59.158
<v Westman, Claire>fairly short,
where there's limited word count.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8049-0
01:01:00.488 --> 01:01:04.783
<v Westman, Claire>If you're including very long paragraphs
or very long quotes,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8049-1
01:01:04.783 --> 01:01:10.256
<v Westman, Claire>generally what it shows us is that you
don't have a full grasp of the content,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8049-2
01:01:10.256 --> 01:01:13.928
<v Westman, Claire>or that you don't really understand it
too well, OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8085-0
01:01:13.928 --> 01:01:17.776
<v Westman, Claire>So what we want to see is you writing in
your own words,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8085-1
01:01:17.776 --> 01:01:22.838
<v Westman, Claire>you explaining what you've read and you
understand so that we can see your</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8085-2
01:01:22.838 --> 01:01:27.968
<v Westman, Claire>understanding so that you can develop
your discussion and your argument so.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8092-0
01:01:28.928 --> 01:01:31.208
<v Westman, Claire>That is why it is preferable.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8114-0
01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:37.967
<v Westman, Claire>It's best for you to only include short
quotes or one or two sentences here or</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8114-1
01:01:37.967 --> 01:01:41.475
<v Westman, Claire>there,
or short phrases instead of whole</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8114-2
01:01:41.475 --> 01:01:42.758
<v Westman, Claire>paragraphs. OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8148-0
01:01:44.568 --> 01:01:48.839
<v Westman, Claire>Obviously,
if you're in putting whole quotes whole</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8148-1
01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:53.948
<v Westman, Claire>paragraphs in it will lead to you not
getting as many marks,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8148-2
01:01:53.948 --> 01:01:57.968
<v Westman, Claire>because it's not necessarily your own
work, OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8171-0
01:01:57.968 --> 01:02:02.861
<v Westman, Claire>So quoting is fine,
but you do have to consider limiting the</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8171-1
01:02:02.861 --> 01:02:09.518
<v Westman, Claire>quotas and focusing more on paraphrasing
and explaining, rather than just quoting.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8182-0
01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:19.678
<v Westman, Claire>OK. OK.
And then we've got a question from Luanda.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8186-0
01:02:26.508 --> 01:02:27.468
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>Hi everyone.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8185-0

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8226-0
01:02:36.618 --> 01:02:41.257
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>So would you have any notes uploaded or
anything uploaded referring to what you</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8209-0

<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8226-1
01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:42.938
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>were talking about initially?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8243-0
01:02:43.818 --> 01:02:49.333
<v Westman, Claire>I'll load this recording so you can go
back and watch the recording in whenever</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8238-0
01:02:46.708 --> 01:02:47.228
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>Oh, OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8243-1

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8241-0

<v Westman, Claire>Perfect, no problem.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8262-0
01:02:55.768 --> 01:02:58.488
<v Westman, Claire>OK. Are they there still two hands up?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8266-0
01:02:59.128 --> 01:03:04.968
<v Westman, Claire>I assume infundashcape.
Is it a legacy hand OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8273-0
01:03:08.168 --> 01:03:09.448

<v Westman, Claire>I can't.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8281-0
01:03:22.948 --> 01:03:24.708
<v Westman, Claire>You're unmuted.</v>

<v Westman, Claire>But I can't hear you.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8292-0
01:03:35.048 --> 01:03:36.728
<v Westman, Claire>I'm not sure if it's your network.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8304-0
01:03:38.888 --> 01:03:42.928
<v Westman, Claire>So perhaps you can post your chat in the
question.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8312-0

<v Westman, Claire>We are going to.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8352-0
01:04:05.088 --> 01:04:10.765
<v Westman, Claire>I'm going to take two more questions and
then I think we will have to end this</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8352-1
01:04:10.765 --> 01:04:13.208
<v Westman, Claire>'cause. I do have another meeting.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8358-0
01:04:16.088 --> 01:04:16.688
<v Westman, Claire>Oh, OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8370-0

<v Westman, Claire>Oh,
so you did post your question in the chat</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8370-1
01:04:21.135 --> 01:04:24.488
<v Westman, Claire>group allocation, so there is only.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8378-0
01:04:25.038 --> 01:04:26.998
<v Westman, Claire>Do you mean for a tutorial group?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8381-0
01:04:26.998 --> 01:04:29.038
<v Westman, Claire>There is only one tutorial group.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8385-0
01:04:30.608 --> 01:04:31.808
<v Westman, Claire>And that is.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8392-0
01:04:33.728 --> 01:04:35.488
<v Westman, Claire>Beyond my scope, we don't.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8401-0
01:04:35.568 --> 01:04:40.128
<v Westman, Claire>We don't do the allocation that is done
by higher up at the university.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8407-0
01:04:41.808 --> 01:04:43.968
<v Westman, Claire>So I'm not sure exactly how it works.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8409-0
01:04:45.888 --> 01:04:46.168
<v Westman, Claire>But.</v>

01:04:47.888 --> 01:04:51.541
<v Westman, Claire>All the most important information is

<v Westman, Claire>so please use that.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8443-0
01:04:55.468 --> 01:04:59.445
<v Westman, Claire>There was a question about if we can add
the declaration at the end of the</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8443-1

<v Westman, Claire>Again, I've gone over this.</v>

<v Westman, Claire>That is your honesty declaration, OK?</v>

01:05:20.438 --> 01:05:21.998

01:05:27.328 --> 01:05:31.248
<v Westman, Claire>You can just click there that counts as
your honesty declaration. OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8537-0
01:05:33.448 --> 01:05:37.322
<v Westman, Claire>Last question, I'm going to take for now,
just so we can,</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8537-1
01:05:37.322 --> 01:05:40.728
<v Westman, Claire>because we've gone over quite a lot today.
Luanda.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8542-0
01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:48.718
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>It's an old hand. Sorry, ma'am.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8544-0
01:05:48.718 --> 01:05:49.558
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>Forgot to put it down.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8546-0
01:05:50.178 --> 01:05:50.858
<v Westman, Claire>Oh, OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8548-0
01:05:51.418 --> 01:05:52.858
<v Westman, Claire>No problem. OK.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8563-0
01:05:54.408 --> 01:05:59.088
<v Westman, Claire>So I think we will leave it there for now,
'cause. We've covered a lot today.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8574-0
01:05:59.528 --> 01:06:05.208
<v Westman, Claire>Let me just look quickly in the chat,
but thank you to Mr. Poppy.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8580-0
01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:07.448
<v Westman, Claire>He's been answering a lot of questions
there.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8593-0
01:06:09.448 --> 01:06:11.971
<v Westman, Claire>If you've already submitted,
you did your referencing at the end.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8593-1
01:06:11.971 --> 01:06:12.888
<v Westman, Claire>What is going to happen?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8595-0
01:06:17.128 --> 01:06:17.968
<v Westman, Claire>You can.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8598-0
01:06:19.528 --> 01:06:20.048
<v Westman, Claire>Resubmit.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8609-0
01:06:25.298 --> 01:06:28.437
<v Westman, Claire>Yeah,
just send me an e-mail and we will have a</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8609-1
01:06:28.437 --> 01:06:29.418
<v Westman, Claire>look there, OK?</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8621-0
01:06:34.338 --> 01:06:39.378
<v Westman, Claire>You don't have to write the word count at
the end. You can include it.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8635-0
01:06:41.408 --> 01:06:44.848
<v Westman, Claire>But obviously we can sort of tell
straight away how many words it is.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8643-0
01:06:44.848 --> 01:06:47.328
<v Westman, Claire>But it can be helpful if you include a
word count.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8659-0
01:06:49.318 --> 01:06:56.968
<v Westman, Claire>And yes, if you're answering 300 words,
you can write in paragraphs.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8681-0
01:06:57.808 --> 01:07:03.980
<v Westman, Claire>Remember 1 idea per paragraph,
so you can write in paragraphs when you</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8681-1
01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:09.717
<v Westman, Claire>answer those questions,
because 300 words is about came your page</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8681-2
01:07:09.717 --> 01:07:10.238
<v Westman, Claire>or so.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8689-0
01:07:10.238 --> 01:07:14.398
<v Westman, Claire>So it would be best to have some
paragraphs. OK, alright.</v>

da2092ad-dac9-4ca4-b2d7-4c7748bf11cb/8707-0
01:07:15.968 --> 01:07:18.238
