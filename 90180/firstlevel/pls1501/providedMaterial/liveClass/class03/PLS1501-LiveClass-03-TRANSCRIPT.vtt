00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Westman, Claire>Again,
you might have to try and leave and come</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/84-1
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.130
<v Westman, Claire>back.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/87-0
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Westman, Claire>Unfortunately.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/92-0
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.840
<v Westman, Claire>Can everybody else see it?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/104-0
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Westman, Claire>Just give me a thumbs up because I see a
lot of people can, but can you OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/111-0
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.260
<v Westman, Claire>Oh, that was a lot of thumbs up in one go,
OK?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/114-0
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.580
<v Westman, Claire>Well, fantastic. Thank you.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/129-0
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.465
<v Westman, Claire>Like I've never seen so many thumbs up in
one go in a meeting that was quite</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/129-1
00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:33.080
<v Westman, Claire>exciting.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/137-0
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.920
<v Westman, Claire>OK, if you're having trouble seeing it,
maybe try.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/144-0
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.000
<v Westman, Claire>Leaving it coming back or yeah.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/153-0
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Westman, Claire>Otherwise,
maybe just stay in the meeting for now.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/157-0
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.790
<v Westman, Claire>If you want to and then.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/170-0
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.519
<v Westman, Claire>OK,
you can see it through your phone and not</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/170-1
00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Westman, Claire>your PC, OK?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/185-0
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.356
<v Westman, Claire>So it might be something to do with your
settings or your network or something</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/185-1
00:00:58.356 --> 00:00:59.350
<v Westman, Claire>along those lines.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/189-0
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/192-0
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.560
<v Westman, Claire>So welcome everybody.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/203-0
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Westman, Claire>It's so nice to again see so many people
joining today.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/222-0
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.332
<v Westman, Claire>Very exciting and I hope you have all
been having a good week so far and that</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/222-1
00:01:12.332 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Westman, Claire>the Semester is going OK so far.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/234-0
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Westman, Claire>I know a lot of people are panicking
about the assessment and just about.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/251-0
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.315
<v Westman, Claire>Philosophy in general,
and like I said in the last meeting,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/251-1
00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy is it's different.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/255-0
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.030
<v Westman, Claire>It's a different kind of text.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/273-0
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.559
<v Westman, Claire>It's a different way of reading and
thinking than you're probably used to,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/273-1
00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:37.430
<v Westman, Claire>so please don't panic too much.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/285-0
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.717
<v Westman, Claire>You will hopefully sort of get used to it
as you're going through as you're reading</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/285-1
00:01:43.717 --> 00:01:44.000
<v Westman, Claire>more.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/303-0
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.385
<v Westman, Claire>And also just use different resources
because sometimes some people learn</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/303-1
00:01:50.385 --> 00:01:52.600
<v Westman, Claire>better using different kinds of resources.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/340-0
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.014
<v Westman, Claire>If, for example,
you are struggling with understanding</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/340-1
00:01:58.014 --> 00:02:03.608
<v Westman, Claire>what's in the study guide,
there are so many very good videos on</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/340-2
00:02:03.608 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Westman, Claire>YouTube that breakdown these complex
concepts into quite simple explanations.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/351-0
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.973
<v Westman, Claire>And obviously you know,
those are resources that are available to</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/351-1
00:02:14.973 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Westman, Claire>you.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/356-0
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.840
<v Westman, Claire>So go and do your own research.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/361-0
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Westman, Claire>Go look and see what you can find.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/370-0
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.000
<v Westman, Claire>That will help you look for different
kinds of texts.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/379-0
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.630
<v Westman, Claire>Look for different kinds of blogs.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/401-0
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.939
<v Westman, Claire>Anything that's going to help you
understand better.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/401-1
00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:37.060
<v Westman, Claire>Just remember that when it comes to
including evidence in your assignments,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/401-2
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Westman, Claire>it must be credible.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/404-0
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Westman, Claire>Academic evidence.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/422-0
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.691
<v Westman, Claire>So while I suggest you go and watch
videos and you can read blogs you can</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/422-1
00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:48.080
<v Westman, Claire>read.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/456-0
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.076
<v Westman, Claire>Whatever you can find that helps you
understand when you are using the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/456-1
00:02:55.076 --> 00:02:59.876
<v Westman, Claire>information in your assignment,
you must make sure that it is from</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/456-2
00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Westman, Claire>credible academic sources.
So use those online databases.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/458-0
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.190
<v Westman, Claire>I put the video.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/466-0
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.390
<v Westman, Claire>Online for you if you haven't watched it
yet.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/476-0
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.040
<v Westman, Claire>Please some people. OK,
let me just mute all in case.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/478-0
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/500-0
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.733
<v Westman, Claire>Please make sure that you go and watch
that video if you don't know how to use</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/500-1
00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:22.040
<v Westman, Claire>the online databases yet.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/507-0
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Westman, Claire>Hopefully those of you who have watched
it already found it helpful.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/535-0
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.777
<v Westman, Claire>I know it was about half an hour,
but I wanted to make sure that you fully</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/535-1
00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:35.360
<v Westman, Claire>understood how to use it and could play
around on it, not just for this module.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/558-0
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.597
<v Westman, Claire>But for all your modules,
so please use resources available to you</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/558-1
00:03:39.597 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Westman, Claire>and don't just panic because you don't
understand what's in the study guide.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/601-0
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.097
<v Westman, Claire>There are lots of resources that you can
use that try that will hopefully help you</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/601-1
00:03:50.097 --> 00:03:55.002
<v Westman, Claire>to understand a bit better.
So in today's session I'm just going to</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/601-2
00:03:55.002 --> 00:04:00.628
<v Westman, Claire>be going over some of the content that
might help you to answer questions one</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/601-3
00:04:00.628 --> 00:04:03.080
<v Westman, Claire>and question 2 for assessment one.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/604-0
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.440
<v Westman, Claire>Next week.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/619-0
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.216
<v Westman, Claire>I know it's the day before your
assignment is due,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/619-1
00:04:08.216 --> 00:04:10.470
<v Westman, Claire>but we're going to look at question 3.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/651-0
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.296
<v Westman, Claire>So what I suggest is that by the time we
get to next Wednesday,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/651-1
00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:21.179
<v Westman, Claire>you have question one and two complete
and finished and happy you're happy with</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/651-2
00:04:21.179 --> 00:04:25.590
<v Westman, Claire>it to submit and that you've started
working on Question 3.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/662-0
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.710
<v Westman, Claire>So make sure you've done the reading for
Question 3.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/673-0
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.093
<v Westman, Claire>Make sure you've started coming up with
your answers so that when we do the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/673-1
00:04:33.093 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Westman, Claire>session.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/682-0
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Westman, Claire>You can just go back and check if there's
any.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/692-0
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.590
<v Westman, Claire>Thing you need to add or anything you
need to change.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/713-0
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.062
<v Westman, Claire>And you think extra that's come up while
we were doing the session so that you</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/713-1
00:04:46.062 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Westman, Claire>don't have to then rush to try and finish
it by the next day.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/718-0
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.790
<v Westman, Claire>So that's my suggestion for you.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/758-0
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.802
<v Westman, Claire>We're not going to approach this semester
quite this way,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/758-1
00:04:58.802 --> 00:05:04.376
<v Westman, Claire>but I've seen on the the WhatsApp group
and from the emails and on the platform</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/758-2
00:05:04.376 --> 00:05:09.880
<v Westman, Claire>that there is quite a lot of stress and I
don't want you to stress so much so.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/764-0
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.230
<v Westman, Claire>We're going to do that today.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/782-0
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.445
<v Westman, Claire>So we're going to look at question one
and then we're going to look at Question</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/782-1
00:05:16.445 --> 00:05:16.550
<v Westman, Claire>2.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/787-0
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Westman, Claire>Then you can ask questions.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/818-0
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.486
<v Westman, Claire>I do want to keep this within an hour
because I know you have a lot going on</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/818-1
00:05:24.486 --> 00:05:29.678
<v Westman, Claire>and you need to work on the assignment
and everybody's busy and you've got other</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/818-2
00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:30.190
<v Westman, Claire>classes.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/838-0
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.316
<v Westman, Claire>So we're going to try and keep it so that
we end by 11. Obviously,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/838-1
00:05:34.316 --> 00:05:39.550

have, you're welcome to e-mail them to me.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/852-0
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.230
<v Westman, Claire>Put them on the PLS 1501 site.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/883-0
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.993
<v Westman, Claire>It's great to see that a lot of you are
what's also great to see is on the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/883-1
00:05:48.993 --> 00:05:53.925
<v Westman, Claire>WhatsApp group that you're all helping
each other and giving each other advice</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/883-2
00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Westman, Claire>and suggestions. That is fantastic.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/889-0
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.630
<v Westman, Claire>I'm so glad to see that.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/912-0
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.431
<v Westman, Claire>So thank you to everybody for engaging
with each other for helping each other</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/912-1
00:06:02.431 --> 00:06:06.910
<v Westman, Claire>and for trying to help everyone else be
successful as well in the module.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/917-0
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Westman, Claire>So because we're focusing.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/930-0
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.910
<v Westman, Claire>On the questions that you have for the
assessment, I'm not going to go into.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/936-0
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.200
<v Westman, Claire>Detail about units one and two.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/960-0
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.567
<v Westman, Claire>We're going to look at what would most
likely be the most useful information to</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/960-1
00:06:26.567 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Westman, Claire>help you answer the assessments questions.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/970-0
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.600
<v Westman, Claire>I'm also not going to go over everything
that's in your study guide.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/984-0
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.026
<v Westman, Claire>The study guide is there for you to read
and hopefully after the lesson,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/984-1
00:06:40.026 --> 00:06:41.560
<v Westman, Claire>if you go back and read.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/992-0
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.430
<v Westman, Claire>You might feel a little bit more
comfortable with it as well.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1007-0
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.200
<v Westman, Claire>So I'm definitely not going over the
study guards information.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1028-0
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.162
<v Westman, Claire>We're going to look at very summarized
version of those two sections of the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1028-1
00:06:54.162 --> 00:06:57.400
<v Westman, Claire>study guide that will be important for
right now.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1030-0
00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.240
<v Westman, Claire>So.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1054-0
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.991
<v Westman, Claire>You might still have questions about
units one and two,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1054-1
00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:09.665
<v Westman, Claire>but we will also come back to those after
the assessment is submitted and you're</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1054-2
00:07:09.665 --> 00:07:11.280
<v Westman, Claire>feeling a bit less panicked.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1057-0
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.730
<v Westman, Claire>OK so.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1064-0
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.320
<v Westman, Claire>The first question is.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1074-0
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.040
<v Westman, Claire>Related to African philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1117-0
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.770
<v Westman, Claire>So the question asks you is the continued
dominance of Western philosophy in an</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1117-1
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:34.138
<v Westman, Claire>African country something ethically
desirable and sustainable? In your answer,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1117-2
00:07:34.138 --> 00:07:40.507
<v Westman, Claire>you must consider the potential benefits
and drawbacks of prioritising Western</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1117-3
00:07:40.507 --> 00:07:42.280
<v Westman, Claire>philosophical thought.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1143-0
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.380
<v Westman, Claire>In this context,
so the first thing I want to do is</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1143-1
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:52.033
<v Westman, Claire>breakdown this question so you will see
I've highlighted some words here and the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1143-2
00:07:52.033 --> 00:07:52.870
<v Westman, Claire>oops, sorry.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1148-0
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.760
<v Westman, Claire>Dominance of Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1158-0
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.400
<v Westman, Claire>Let's see dominance of Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1159-0
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.200
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1164-0
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.880
<v Westman, Claire>Maybe that's making it worse.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1165-0
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.440
<v Westman, Claire>Harder to see.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1173-0
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.885
<v Westman, Claire>Oh,
so that is content that you have to focus</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1173-1
00:08:10.885 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Westman, Claire>on.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1214-0
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.492
<v Westman, Claire>In an African country,
you can look specifically at South Africa</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1214-1
00:08:16.492 --> 00:08:19.638
<v Westman, Claire>because that is focused on in your study
guide,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1214-2
00:08:19.638 --> 00:08:23.178
<v Westman, Claire>you can speak about African countries
more generally,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1214-3
00:08:23.178 --> 00:08:28.488
<v Westman, Claire>but I think it would be beneficial for
you to focus on South Africa because that</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1214-4
00:08:28.488 --> 00:08:30.520
<v Westman, Claire>is what is discussed in detail.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1231-0
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.559
<v Westman, Claire>In the study guide,
So what we're looking at is how Western</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1231-1
00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.510
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy is still dominant.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1234-0
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.800
<v Westman, Claire>In African.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1239-0
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.680
<v Westman, Claire>Universities, African institutions.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1247-0
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.550
<v Westman, Claire>Higher learning institutions so.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1259-0
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.630
<v Westman, Claire>What are the potential benefits of
Western philosophy?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1282-0
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:55.725
<v Westman, Claire>What are the potential drawbacks of
making Western philosophy more prominent</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1282-1
00:08:55.725 --> 00:09:00.790
<v Westman, Claire>in an African country than it is than is
African philosophy OK?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1311-0
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.790
<v Westman, Claire>So that's the content.
The dominance of Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1311-1
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:10.124
<v Westman, Claire>Your focus is on an African country and
some of the things you're going to look</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1311-2
00:09:10.124 --> 00:09:14.590
<v Westman, Claire>at are the benefits of prioritizing
Western philosophical thought.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1319-0
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.160
<v Westman, Claire>And the negatives or the drawbacks?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1339-0
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.510
<v Westman, Claire>Of prioritizing Western philosophy at
philosophical thought,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1339-1
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.230
<v Westman, Claire>but what you also need to argue is an
ethically desirable.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1352-0
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.120
<v Westman, Claire>Is it something that can be argued for
ethically?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1369-0
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.260
<v Westman, Claire>Should this should Western philosophy
continue to be prioritized over African</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1369-1
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.120
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1375-0
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.600
<v Westman, Claire>What are the ethical implications of that?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1384-0
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.900
<v Westman, Claire>And then is it sustainable?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1388-0
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.380
<v Westman, Claire>Can it continue?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1398-0
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:55.100
<v Westman, Claire>Can we continue to prioritize Western
philosophy in an African context?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1410-0
00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.600
<v Westman, Claire>What are the problems that might make it
unsustainable?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1417-0
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.680
<v Westman, Claire>What are the reasons that it might be
sustainable?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1431-0
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:11.150
<v Westman, Claire>So what this question is asking you is to
think about why Western philosophy is</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1431-1
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.950
<v Westman, Claire>dominant.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1437-0
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.910
<v Westman, Claire>Why it is a problem?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1454-0
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:21.836
<v Westman, Claire>Or maybe not a problem that it is
prioritized and should it continue to be</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1454-1
00:10:21.836 --> 00:10:23.550
<v Westman, Claire>prioritized or not?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1457-0
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:25.480
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1473-0
00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:30.555
<v Westman, Claire>So whenever you have a question,
try to break it down and think what what</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1473-1
00:10:30.555 --> 00:10:32.680
<v Westman, Claire>is the content of the question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1486-0
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.720
<v Westman, Claire>So what is the focus of the question and
what is it asking me to do?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1492-0
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.600
<v Westman, Claire>How am I supposed to answer this?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1499-0
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.800
<v Westman, Claire>So you will see that this is not just
asking you.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1518-0
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:49.088
<v Westman, Claire>To explain why Western philosophy is
prioritized,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1518-1
00:10:49.088 --> 00:10:52.390
<v Westman, Claire>it's asking you to go beyond that.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1525-0
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.750
<v Westman, Claire>It's asking you to develop an argument.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1563-0
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.298
<v Westman, Claire>For where you explain why you think it is
desirable or not,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1563-1
00:11:01.298 --> 00:11:04.214
<v Westman, Claire>and why you think it is sustainable or
not,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1563-2
00:11:04.214 --> 00:11:09.119
<v Westman, Claire>so you're going to go beyond just
explaining what's in the study guide in</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1563-3
00:11:09.119 --> 00:11:13.560
<v Westman, Claire>order to develop this argument that shows
us what your opinion is.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1577-0
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.233
<v Westman, Claire>But remember,
these are not opinion pieces,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1577-1
00:11:17.233 --> 00:11:20.310
<v Westman, Claire>so they need to be backed up with your
evidence.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1600-0
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Westman, Claire>Again, the study guide is the main source,
but you can use other any other academic</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1600-1
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.670
<v Westman, Claire>resources that help you to answer the
question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1603-0
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.310
<v Westman, Claire>So let's break it down.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1612-0
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.280
<v Westman, Claire>The introduction of Western philosophy to
South Africa.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1619-0
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.920
<v Westman, Claire>Came with sort of the colonization of
Africa.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1641-0
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.814
<v Westman, Claire>And with the arrival of colonizers in
South Africa, so again,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1641-1
00:11:48.814 --> 00:11:51.480
<v Westman, Claire>I'm not going to go into this in detail.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1643-0
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.200
<v Westman, Claire>It's in your study guide.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1690-0
00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.957
<v Westman, Claire>And this is not necessarily something you
need to explain in detail,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1690-1
00:12:00.957 --> 00:12:06.929
<v Westman, Claire>but it might help you to provide a little
bit of background into the question or</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1690-2
00:12:06.929 --> 00:12:11.426
<v Westman, Claire>into your answer to say why it is not
ethically sustainable,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1690-3
00:12:11.426 --> 00:12:15.480
<v Westman, Claire>why it is or ethically desirable,
why it is a problem.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1703-0
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.070
<v Westman, Claire>That Western philosophy is still
prioritized.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1714-0
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:24.076
<v Westman, Claire>So when Western philosophy was brought to
South African universities and</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1714-1
00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:24.910
<v Westman, Claire>institutions.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1736-0
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:32.952
<v Westman, Claire>There was 2 main traditions that were
brought into our universities,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1736-1
00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:37.430
<v Westman, Claire>so the first was the Afrikaans
Continental tradition.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1752-0
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.600
<v Westman, Claire>And in the study guide it explains that
this was found in particular universities.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1775-0
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:49.526
<v Westman, Claire>The kinds of people that some of the most
influential figures in the tradition,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1775-1
00:12:49.526 --> 00:12:53.880
<v Westman, Claire>what sort of the philosophy focused on,
but the main point.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1833-0
00:12:54.430 --> 00:13:01.901
<v Westman, Claire>Is that philosophical theories that came
out of this tradition were often used to</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1833-1
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:06.456
<v Westman, Claire>support and justify apartheid and
discrimination,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1833-2
00:13:06.456 --> 00:13:13.471
<v Westman, Claire>so they were bringing philosophical
theories from Europe to South Africa and</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1833-3
00:13:13.471 --> 00:13:20.030
<v Westman, Claire>then using those as justification for
apartheid and for discrimination.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1839-0
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.960
<v Westman, Claire>Against the indigenous people of South
Africa.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1852-0
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.240
<v Westman, Claire>The other main tradition was the
Anglo-Saxon tradition.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1885-0
00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.350
<v Westman, Claire>Again,
go read through your study guide to see</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1885-1
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:36.378
<v Westman, Claire>which universities it was founded,
who the sort of most prominent figures in</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1885-2
00:13:36.378 --> 00:13:40.101
<v Westman, Claire>their tradition were,
and sort of what the focus of that</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1885-3
00:13:40.101 --> 00:13:41.080
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy was.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1905-0
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.552
<v Westman, Claire>But again,
it was also used to justify racial and</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1905-1
00:13:44.552 --> 00:13:48.560
<v Westman, Claire>cultural discrimination when it sort of
first came to the country.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1908-0
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:49.480
<v Westman, Claire>However.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1916-0
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Westman, Claire>In this tradition or in these
universities?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1934-0
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:59.223
<v Westman, Claire>There was a movement towards social and
political resistance against apartheid,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1934-1
00:13:59.223 --> 00:14:00.750
<v Westman, Claire>against discrimination.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1972-0
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:08.650
<v Westman, Claire>And so that can be seen sort of arising
in what were traditionally sort of more</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1972-1
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:14.859
<v Westman, Claire>English speaking universities. However,
you will see in the study guide that</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1972-2
00:14:14.859 --> 00:14:17.680
<v Westman, Claire>there's also a lot of contestation.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/1984-0
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.920
<v Westman, Claire>There's a lot of critique of this idea
because it was argued that.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2019-0
00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:29.952
<v Westman, Claire>A lot of political resistance came out of
these universities that there were people</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2019-1
00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:35.123
<v Westman, Claire>sort of standing up against
discrimination and against apartheid</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2019-2
00:14:35.123 --> 00:14:37.270
<v Westman, Claire>ideologies, but very often.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2031-0
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.440
<v Westman, Claire>In reality,
that wasn't really the situation.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2056-0
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.401
<v Westman, Claire>It was still this ongoing discrimination,
this ongoing hierarchy in the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2056-1
00:14:46.401 --> 00:14:52.051
<v Westman, Claire>universities that privileged white people
that privileged Western ideologies over</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2056-2
00:14:52.051 --> 00:14:53.360
<v Westman, Claire>African ideologies.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2061-0
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.960
<v Westman, Claire>They're privileged.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2077-0
00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:02.414
<v Westman, Claire>The colonizers,
rather than making a real move towards</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2077-1
00:15:02.414 --> 00:15:04.880
<v Westman, Claire>decolonization, towards.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2087-0
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.320
<v Westman, Claire>Sort of going against discrimination and
going against.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2099-0
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:17.800
<v Westman, Claire>The subordination of indigenous or black
people in South Africa.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2109-0
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.880
<v Westman, Claire>So these are just the sort of main
traditions that came into South Africa.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2118-0
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:29.030
<v Westman, Claire>When philosophy was first introduced into
universities.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2126-0
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.160
<v Westman, Claire>Go read through that section.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2130-0
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.080
<v Westman, Claire>It's not imperative.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2168-0
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:40.502
<v Westman, Claire>It's not vital for your assignment,
but it can help you to sort of have the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2168-1
00:15:40.502 --> 00:15:47.431
<v Westman, Claire>background or the the groundwork for why
Western philosophy became so dominant in</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2168-2
00:15:47.431 --> 00:15:52.924
<v Westman, Claire>South African philosoph philosophy
departments in the 1st place,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2168-3
00:15:52.924 --> 00:15:54.360
<v Westman, Claire>but also for why.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2174-0
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.510
<v Westman, Claire>It might still be problematic K,
because if.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2192-0
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:06.160
<v Westman, Claire>These traditions are still sort of the
foundation of philosophy departments</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2192-1
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.320
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy curricula today.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2200-0
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.680
<v Westman, Claire>Are they still contributing towards?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2219-0
00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.505
<v Westman, Claire>The undermining of African knowledge
systems,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2219-1
00:16:17.505 --> 00:16:22.200
<v Westman, Claire>are they still contributing to
privileging Western knowledge over?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2223-0
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.280
<v Westman, Claire>African knowledge.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2230-0
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:29.310
<v Westman, Claire>Are they still perpetuating the ideas?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2243-0
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.960
<v Westman, Claire>That came when they were first introduced
in South Africa in Africa.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2252-0
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.800
<v Westman, Claire>Sorry, I've got a bit of a cough today.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2256-0
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.670
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2267-0
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:45.590
<v Westman, Claire>So that's sort of just to help you have
that foundation for understanding.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2269-0
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.280
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2286-0
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.019
<v Westman, Claire>Obviously,
over time there has been a lot of change</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2286-1
00:16:52.019 --> 00:16:53.320
<v Westman, Claire>in philosophy curricula.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2296-0
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.960
<v Westman, Claire>There's been a lot of change in
philosophy departments.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2323-0
00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:02.579
<v Westman, Claire>There's been a move towards trying to
bring in more African philosophy to</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2323-1
00:17:02.579 --> 00:17:09.560
<v Westman, Claire>trying to do away with a lot of the sort
of hierarchies and the discrimination.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2333-0
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.396
<v Westman, Claire>That was present,
but it's for you to think about.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2333-1
00:17:13.396 --> 00:17:14.710
<v Westman, Claire>Has this happened?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2344-0
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.680
<v Westman, Claire>Our philosophy departments you might.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2349-0
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.440
<v Westman, Claire>You obviously might not have a lot of.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2368-0
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.391
<v Westman, Claire>Experience with philosophy departments,
but thinking about it,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2368-1
00:17:27.391 --> 00:17:30.160
<v Westman, Claire>do you think that we have made a move?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2393-0
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.071
<v Westman, Claire>So what this has led to is that in
contemporary philosophy departments,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2393-1
00:17:35.071 --> 00:17:39.680
<v Westman, Claire>contemporary philosophy curriculums just
contemporary philosophy in general.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2408-0
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:47.870
<v Westman, Claire>African experiences have been disregarded
in favor of Western experiences.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2413-0
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Westman, Claire>Western Knowledge Systems,
Western beliefs.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2431-0
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:57.400
<v Westman, Claire>This means that African philosophy
remains largely marginalized or devalued.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2452-0
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.960
<v Westman, Claire>And it's often seen as an inferior
alternative to Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2461-0
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.560
<v Westman, Claire>So even where African philosophy is
offered at universities, often it is.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2478-0
00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:14.470
<v Westman, Claire>Is considered to be sort of and you'll
see it says this in the study guide,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2478-1
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.030
<v Westman, Claire>like in quotes and quotes.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2491-0
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:21.670
<v Westman, Claire>An exotic option rather than the main
philosophy that you study.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2521-0
00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:26.200
<v Westman, Claire>It's like it's sort of an alternative to
Western philosophy,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2521-1
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.358
<v Westman, Claire>which is considered the main or
predominant philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2521-2
00:18:30.358 --> 00:18:35.110
<v Westman, Claire>So African philosophy remains undervalued.
It remains marginal.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2532-0
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.360
<v Westman, Claire>It remains considered inferior to Western
philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2550-0
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:46.326
<v Westman, Claire>And obviously this is tied to racist
ideas around the humanity and rationality</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2550-1
00:18:46.326 --> 00:18:47.270
<v Westman, Claire>of Africans.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2560-0
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:51.590
<v Westman, Claire>So if you are doing introduction to
African philosophy as well.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2592-0
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:59.496
<v Westman, Claire>You will there learn quite a lot about
how a lot of the reason that African</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2592-1
00:18:59.496 --> 00:19:05.582
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy is still marginalized and
devalued is because of this ongoing</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2592-2
00:19:05.582 --> 00:19:09.000
<v Westman, Claire>colonial racist idea that African people.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2600-0
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.110
<v Westman, Claire>Cannot use rationality.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2634-0
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:17.562
<v Westman, Claire>African people cannot reason as well as
Western people as well as white people,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2634-1
00:19:17.562 --> 00:19:23.933
<v Westman, Claire>so this is an awful ongoing racist idea
that continues to play into the reason</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2634-2
00:19:23.933 --> 00:19:26.110
<v Westman, Claire>that African philosophy is.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2639-0
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.230
<v Westman, Claire>Considered marginal?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2650-0
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.990
<v Westman, Claire>Always considered as inferior to Western
philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2660-0
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.825
<v Westman, Claire>Obviously there's been a lot of change
around those ideas has been a lot of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2660-1
00:19:36.825 --> 00:19:37.350
<v Westman, Claire>progress.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2686-0
00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.808
<v Westman, Claire>Towards moving away from those ideas,
but some of the reason why African</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2686-1
00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:49.320
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy is still not considered as
important as Western philosophy ties into.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2697-0
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:56.240
<v Westman, Claire>The the ideologies associated with
African reason and rationality.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2714-0
00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:01.082
<v Westman, Claire>Team.
So in order for philosophy to be</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2714-1
00:20:01.082 --> 00:20:04.430
<v Westman, Claire>liberated and to be considered.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2722-0
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.200
<v Westman, Claire>You know as important or even or as
valuable or.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2738-0
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:17.870
<v Westman, Claire>To sort of have as important a place in
philosophy as does Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2767-0
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.812
<v Westman, Claire>That is argued that African philosophy
should become the lens or the framework</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2767-1
00:20:23.812 --> 00:20:28.487
<v Westman, Claire>through which other philosophical
traditions are viewed and engaged with.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2767-2
00:20:28.487 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Westman, Claire>As it currently stands.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2791-0
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:36.860
<v Westman, Claire>Western philosophy is considered the
framework or the the lens through which</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2791-1
00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.750
<v Westman, Claire>we view African philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2804-0
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:45.077
<v Westman, Claire>So we use Western philosophical
frameworks or ideas to understand Africa</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2804-1
00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.070
<v Westman, Claire>and African philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2816-0
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.980
<v Westman, Claire>And I see a very good question in the
chat, which we're going to get to.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2829-0
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:59.070
<v Westman, Claire>Which we're going to think about now as
we move through these.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2832-0
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.830
<v Westman, Claire>So it's a very good question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2834-0
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.230
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2878-0
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:11.511
<v Westman, Claire>So when you are answering the question,
let's just go back and look at the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2878-1
00:21:11.511 --> 00:21:14.803
<v Westman, Claire>question again when you're answering the
question,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2878-2
00:21:14.803 --> 00:21:19.838
<v Westman, Claire>you're asked to consider the potential
benefits and drawbacks or negatives of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2878-3
00:21:19.838 --> 00:21:23.710
<v Westman, Claire>prioritizing Western philosophical
thought in this context.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2889-0
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:30.950
<v Westman, Claire>So what it's asking you to do is to think
about why it might be justifiable.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2894-0
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:33.270
<v Westman, Claire>And a good thing.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2901-0
00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.420
<v Westman, Claire>To continue to prioritize Western thought.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2908-0
00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:39.990
<v Westman, Claire>And White might not be.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2916-0
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.230
<v Westman, Claire>So let's look at some of the value of
Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2921-0
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.750
<v Westman, Claire>So Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2936-0
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:53.310
<v Westman, Claire>Can provide us with studying Western
philosophy like you are in this module.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2949-0
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:58.102
<v Westman, Claire>Can give insights into and knowledge of
theories that are very prominent in</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2949-1
00:21:58.102 --> 00:21:59.310
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy globally.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2953-0
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.150
<v Westman, Claire>They can then be applied to African.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/2968-0
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.900
<v Westman, Claire>Challenges, context, realities.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3012-0
00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.973
<v Westman, Claire>Obviously,
Western philosophy is there's a lot more</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3012-1
00:22:09.973 --> 00:22:13.257
<v Westman, Claire>access to the writings of Western
philosophy,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3012-2
00:22:13.257 --> 00:22:19.041
<v Westman, Claire>and that is one of the reasons it's also
become sort of more dominant is because</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3012-3
00:22:19.041 --> 00:22:23.539
<v Westman, Claire>we have more access to the recordings of
Western philosophers,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3012-4
00:22:23.539 --> 00:22:26.180
<v Westman, Claire>the writings of Western philosophers.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3015-0
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.260
<v Westman, Claire>So we can argue that.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3025-0
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:34.070
<v Westman, Claire>Western philosophy gives us theories.
It gives us information.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3043-0
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:40.371
<v Westman, Claire>And it gives us frameworks that we can
use and that we can apply to African</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3043-1
00:22:40.371 --> 00:22:41.220
<v Westman, Claire>challenges.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3048-0
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.100
<v Westman, Claire>Context live realities.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3068-0
00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:51.100
<v Westman, Claire>We can adapt them in order to make them
relevant to our situations, our contexts.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3077-0
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:56.100
<v Westman, Claire>So that's one thing you might argue in in
favour of Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3091-0
00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:02.579
<v Westman, Claire>Another thing is that the conceptual
tools and frameworks, as I said,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3091-1
00:23:02.579 --> 00:23:03.630
<v Westman, Claire>are recognized.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3121-0
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:09.628
<v Westman, Claire>Understood and applied globally.
So if you want to or currently as it is,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3121-1
00:23:09.628 --> 00:23:14.740
<v Westman, Claire>if you want to engage in philosophy on a
global level, often you need.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3126-0
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.843
<v Westman, Claire>Well,
generally you need to have an</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3126-1
00:23:16.843 --> 00:23:17.660
<v Westman, Claire>understanding.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3146-0
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:25.089
<v Westman, Claire>Of those dominant theories and frameworks,
in order to be able to contribute to the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3146-1
00:23:25.089 --> 00:23:27.310
<v Westman, Claire>global philosophical discourse.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3161-0
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.710
<v Westman, Claire>And then obviously these are also applied
to many other fields like law.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3185-0
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.399
<v Westman, Claire>So to engage in philosophy on a global
level,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3185-1
00:23:36.399 --> 00:23:40.868
<v Westman, Claire>you have to have that foundational
knowledge that comes from Western</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3185-2
00:23:40.868 --> 00:23:41.580
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3224-0
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:46.406
<v Westman, Claire>But we are then able to adapt that to the
African context.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3224-1
00:23:46.406 --> 00:23:51.318
<v Westman, Claire>So that is why you might argue that
Western philosophy is still valued.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3224-2
00:23:51.318 --> 00:23:56.844
<v Westman, Claire>Whether you then say that it should be
prioritized over African philosophy in an</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3224-3
00:23:56.844 --> 00:23:59.300
<v Westman, Claire>African context is another question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3232-0
00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.020
<v Westman, Claire>So remember when you're answering this
question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3256-0
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:11.128
<v Westman, Claire>You can say yes it is justifiable and it
is desirable to prioritize Western</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3256-1
00:24:11.128 --> 00:24:14.350
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy and then you give reasons.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3261-0
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:16.390
<v Westman, Claire>You might say no we should.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3262-0
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:17.750
<v Westman, Claire>Absolutely not.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3286-0
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:26.495
<v Westman, Claire>Prioritize Western philosophy and you can
give reasons or you can give a more</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3286-1
00:24:26.495 --> 00:24:29.230
<v Westman, Claire>neutral stance where you can say.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3297-0
00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.390
<v Westman, Claire>Well,
there is value to Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3322-0
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:38.745
<v Westman, Claire>So This is why we should still
incorporate and have a focus on Western</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3322-1
00:24:38.745 --> 00:24:44.525
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy, but at the same time,
there must be much more focus and</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3322-2
00:24:44.525 --> 00:24:47.670
<v Westman, Claire>prioritization of African philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3336-0
00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.590
<v Westman, Claire>So that remember there's no one correct
answer for these questions.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3343-0
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:58.310
<v Westman, Claire>You need to consider what your stance is.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3363-0
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:04.443
<v Westman, Claire>And then you need to develop an argument
that supports that argument.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3363-1
00:25:04.443 --> 00:25:06.940
<v Westman, Claire>That claim that you are making OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3367-0
00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.780
<v Westman, Claire>So that's what we are looking for when we
mark your work.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3373-0
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:12.750
<v Westman, Claire>Have you taken a stance?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3388-0
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:16.942
<v Westman, Claire>Have you made a claim? So for example,
your claim might be no.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3388-1
00:25:16.942 --> 00:25:19.470
<v Westman, Claire>We must get rid of Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3397-0
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.900
<v Westman, Claire>This. OK. That's a very,
very strong claim,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3397-1
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.390
<v Westman, Claire>and you'd need a very good.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3407-0
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.150
<v Westman, Claire>Argument to support that,
but you might say no.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3411-0
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.510
<v Westman, Claire>Get rid of Western philosophy entirely.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3413-0
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:28.980
<v Westman, Claire>Be.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3432-0
00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:34.637
<v Westman, Claire>We then want to see that you have made a
very valid, good,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3432-1
00:25:34.637 --> 00:25:37.980
<v Westman, Claire>strong argument to support that claim, OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3436-0
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.260
<v Westman, Claire>So we don't.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3437-0
00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.460
<v Westman, Claire>We don't.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3443-0
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.780
<v Westman, Claire>We're not marking you on which answer you
give.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3450-0
00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:46.100
<v Westman, Claire>It's on how you answer the question, OK?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3463-0
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.292
<v Westman, Claire>So when you're answering this question,
you might say this is the value of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3463-1
00:25:49.292 --> 00:25:50.100
<v Westman, Claire>Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3472-0
00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.300
<v Westman, Claire>This is why it should be prioritized.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3483-0
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:56.700
<v Westman, Claire>Or this is the value of Western
philosophy, and even though it has value.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3488-0
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.270
<v Westman, Claire>In an African context.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3503-0
00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.527
<v Westman, Claire>Or even globally,
African philosophy should be prioritized</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3503-1
00:26:03.527 --> 00:26:04.780
<v Westman, Claire>For these reasons.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3506-0
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.390
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3526-0
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:08.881
<v Westman, Claire>I see a lot of questions or comments
coming in,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3526-1
00:26:08.881 --> 00:26:12.150
<v Westman, Claire>so we'll look at them once we are
finished with this question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3549-0
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:18.726
<v Westman, Claire>So some of the suggestions that you might
consider when thinking about prioritising</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3549-1
00:26:18.726 --> 00:26:24.350
<v Westman, Claire>African philosophy is that the ongoing
prioritization of Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3557-0
00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:29.230
<v Westman, Claire>Continues to uphold the idea that
Africans.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3572-0
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.008
<v Westman, Claire>Aren't capable of engaging in rational
philosophical thought,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3572-1
00:26:33.008 --> 00:26:35.860
<v Westman, Claire>so remember that goes back to what I said
earlier.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3614-0
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:43.566
<v Westman, Claire>Prioritising Western philosophy can also
lead to the neglect or distortion of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3614-1
00:26:43.566 --> 00:26:49.662
<v Westman, Claire>indigenous knowledge and therefore
African philosophy should be prioritized</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3614-2
00:26:49.662 --> 00:26:52.950
<v Westman, Claire>in African context or even more globally.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3616-0
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:54.470
<v Westman, Claire>You can argue whichever.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3622-0
00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:59.670
<v Westman, Claire>So because when we are applying.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3641-0
00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:05.523
<v Westman, Claire>Western knowledge to the African context,
that means that we are not always</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3641-1
00:27:05.523 --> 00:27:07.860
<v Westman, Claire>considering indigenous knowledge.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3651-0
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.230
<v Westman, Claire>Or knowledge or belief systems.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3657-0
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.510
<v Westman, Claire>Or frameworks that come out of Africa.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3688-0
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:21.050
<v Westman, Claire>Sometimes we just sort of adapting
African knowledge or African beliefs to</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3688-1
00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:25.053
<v Westman, Claire>the Western framework.
So we might say that we want to</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3688-2
00:27:25.053 --> 00:27:28.110
<v Westman, Claire>prioritize African philosophy as a way to.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3691-0
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:30.110
<v Westman, Claire>Prioritize.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3711-0
00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:36.295
<v Westman, Claire>Indigenous knowledge as a way to make
sure that we don't neglect or distort</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3711-1
00:27:36.295 --> 00:27:37.540
<v Westman, Claire>African beliefs.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3720-0
00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:42.670
<v Westman, Claire>African knowledge systems,
the knowledge and theories that are</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3720-1
00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:44.380
<v Westman, Claire>coming out of Africa.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3730-0
00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:49.139
<v Westman, Claire>And of course,
I'm sure you've heard the word decolonize</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3730-1
00:27:49.139 --> 00:27:49.550
<v Westman, Claire>before.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3758-0
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:54.227
<v Westman, Claire>So the focus,
we could argue that the focus should be</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3758-1
00:27:54.227 --> 00:27:58.279
<v Westman, Claire>on African philosophy as a way to
decolonize the curriculums and enhance</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3758-2
00:27:58.279 --> 00:28:00.110
<v Westman, Claire>the discourse, the philosophical.</v>

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.620
<v Westman, Claire>Knowledge that comes from Africa.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3777-0
00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:09.020
<v Westman, Claire>These are just some suggestions for what
you could include in your answer.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3786-0
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:12.030
<v Westman, Claire>They are not all of them, OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3800-0
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:17.694
<v Westman, Claire>So you are going to, as I say,
think about what your answer to that is.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3800-1
00:28:17.694 --> 00:28:19.110
<v Westman, Claire>Is it sustainable?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3807-0
00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:22.470
<v Westman, Claire>Can this continue in an African context?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3819-0
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:29.590
<v Westman, Claire>Can we continue to prioritize Western
philosophy when it might not be focusing?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3825-0
00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.460
<v Westman, Claire>On African challenges, African.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3832-0
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.670
<v Westman, Claire>Is it ethically desirable?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3859-0
00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:42.001
<v Westman, Claire>So here in terms of ethically desirable,
we think about ethically,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3859-1
00:28:42.001 --> 00:28:46.695
<v Westman, Claire>is it OK to prioritise Western philosophy
in, for example,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3859-2
00:28:46.695 --> 00:28:51.230
<v Westman, Claire>South Africa when it is distorting
indigenous knowledge?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3875-0
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:57.696
<v Westman, Claire>Is it ethically desirable or is it OK
ethically OK to prioritise Western</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3875-1
00:28:57.696 --> 00:28:58.670
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3893-0
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:05.374
<v Westman, Claire>When one of the ways it was used was to
justify discrimination,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3893-1
00:29:05.374 --> 00:29:08.020
<v Westman, Claire>has that changed over time?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3915-0
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.768
<v Westman, Claire>So these are some of the things that
you're going to be thinking about when</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3915-1
00:29:13.768 --> 00:29:15.110
<v Westman, Claire>you answer this assignment.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3931-0
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:20.154
<v Westman, Claire>So these are some ideas of what you might
consider when you are coming up with your</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3931-1
00:29:20.154 --> 00:29:20.550
<v Westman, Claire>answer.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3946-0
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.074
<v Westman, Claire>Obviously you're all going to give us a
different answer,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3946-1
00:29:24.074 --> 00:29:27.510
<v Westman, Claire>and that's like the amazing thing about
philosophy, everybody.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3949-0
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.310
<v Westman, Claire>Sort of gets.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3960-0
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:33.140
<v Westman, Claire>To their own idea and their own claims
and their own arguments.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3968-0
00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.980
<v Westman, Claire>So we just want to see that you have
thought carefully about.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3982-0
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:42.707
<v Westman, Claire>Those how you feel about those if it's
ethically justifiable and if it's</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/3982-1
00:29:42.707 --> 00:29:43.390
<v Westman, Claire>sustainable.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4007-0
00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:50.729
<v Westman, Claire>So some things you could think about,
I think we won't focus on it too much now</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4007-1
00:29:50.729 --> 00:29:54.967
<v Westman, Claire>because of time,
but you might think about how would you</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4007-2
00:29:54.967 --> 00:29:56.900
<v Westman, Claire>define African philosophy?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4043-0
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:02.941
<v Westman, Claire>Do you think that African philosophy is
prioritised in universities?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4043-1
00:30:02.941 --> 00:30:07.565
<v Westman, Claire>And obviously again your first year,
first semester some of you have done</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4043-2
00:30:07.565 --> 00:30:10.751
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy,
maybe at other institutions before you</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4043-3
00:30:10.751 --> 00:30:11.750
<v Westman, Claire>moved to UNICEF.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4054-0
00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:17.303
<v Westman, Claire>But from the little but you know,
do you think African philosophy is</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4054-1
00:30:17.303 --> 00:30:18.180
<v Westman, Claire>prioritized?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4085-0
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:24.609
<v Westman, Claire>Should African philosophy department or
should philosophy departments in Africa</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4085-1
00:30:24.609 --> 00:30:30.180
<v Westman, Claire>focus on Western philosophy or should
they focus more on African philosophy?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4095-0
00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:36.632
<v Westman, Claire>Should Western philosophy be sort of the
alternative and African philosophy be the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4095-1
00:30:36.632 --> 00:30:37.020
<v Westman, Claire>main?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4100-0
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.150
<v Westman, Claire>Philosophical framework.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4107-0
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:41.150
<v Westman, Claire>The main philosophical discourse.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4130-0
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:48.824
<v Westman, Claire>In the departments and how can African
philosophy contribute to improving social</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4130-1
00:30:48.824 --> 00:30:52.500
<v Westman, Claire>political economic conditions in Africa?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4137-0
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.980
<v Westman, Claire>In South Africa,
if you wanted to be more specific.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4140-0
00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:57.110
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4165-0
00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:03.198
<v Westman, Claire>So those that's a bit of the content that
you will need in order to answer question</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4165-1
00:31:03.198 --> 00:31:06.604
<v Westman, Claire>one,
let me look quickly at the chat in the if</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4165-2
00:31:06.604 --> 00:31:08.270
<v Westman, Claire>you have any questions.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4170-0
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:11.750
<v Westman, Claire>Please ask them.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4182-0
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.170
<v Westman, Claire>You can put your hand up or you can ask
him in the chat.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4236-0
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:19.733
<v Westman, Claire>OK. So our first comment says,
don't you think in a way Western</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4236-1
00:31:19.733 --> 00:31:24.220
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy will forever be dominant
considering at the foundation of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4236-2
00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:29.553
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy was founded by colonizers and
we have adopted and lived the way of the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4236-3
00:31:29.553 --> 00:31:32.674
<v Westman, Claire>West,
it would be considerably hard to actually</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4236-4
00:31:32.674 --> 00:31:34.430
<v Westman, Claire>know and establish African.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4252-0
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:36.730
<v Westman, Claire>Philosophy,
unless we dig into the history books,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4252-1
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:39.810
<v Westman, Claire>which would take time to find out the
truth of African philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4262-0
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.990
<v Westman, Claire>That is a very good point,
and that's something that you can</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4262-1
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.350
<v Westman, Claire>consider.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4265-0
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.260
<v Westman, Claire>While you are doing your assignment.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4267-0
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:46.870
<v Westman, Claire>So.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4275-0
00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.350
<v Westman, Claire>A lot of the argument is also that.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4289-0
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:59.080
<v Westman, Claire>Even people doing African philosophy have
been trained in Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4305-0
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.657
<v Westman, Claire>So many,
even prominent African philosophers were</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4305-1
00:32:04.657 --> 00:32:06.590
<v Westman, Claire>trained in institutions.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4330-0
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:13.528
<v Westman, Claire>That only taught Western philosophy,
so there's always that argument that even</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4330-1
00:32:13.528 --> 00:32:18.190
<v Westman, Claire>prominent African philosophers are
influenced by Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4333-0
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:22.190
<v Westman, Claire>So that's a very important point.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4335-0
00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.820
<v Westman, Claire>It's a very good point.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4374-0
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:28.606
<v Westman, Claire>And of course,
the some of the challenge that we find</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4374-1
00:32:28.606 --> 00:32:33.007
<v Westman, Claire>with African philosophy is that a lot of
it was passed down through oral</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4374-2
00:32:33.007 --> 00:32:37.709
<v Westman, Claire>traditions rather than through writing.
And so that's one of the reasons that</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4374-3
00:32:37.709 --> 00:32:41.145
<v Westman, Claire>African philosophies,
the history of African philosophy,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4374-4
00:32:41.145 --> 00:32:42.230
<v Westman, Claire>can be a bit more.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4391-0
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:46.586
<v Westman, Claire>Difficult to dig into because there
aren't the written records that there are</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4391-1
00:32:46.586 --> 00:32:47.870
<v Westman, Claire>for Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4397-0
00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.190
<v Westman, Claire>However,
there is a lot of work being done.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4399-0
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.310
<v Westman, Claire>In Africa.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4401-0
00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.260
<v Westman, Claire>Philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4418-0
00:32:54.790 --> 00:33:01.456
<v Westman, Claire>To go back into looking into indigenous
knowledge systems into developing African</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4418-1
00:33:01.456 --> 00:33:02.350
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4420-0
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.910
<v Westman, Claire>That.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4448-0
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:12.733
<v Westman, Claire>Goes back to some pre colonial ideas,
some pre colonial beliefs and of course</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4448-1
00:33:12.733 --> 00:33:19.860
<v Westman, Claire>again even that is tricky because we know
that colonialism impacted upon.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4457-0
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:24.710
<v Westman, Claire>Cultures and beliefs and traditions so
immensely.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4476-0
00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:31.559
<v Westman, Claire>But this is getting to a much more
complex discussion, but very,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4476-1
00:33:31.559 --> 00:33:33.190
<v Westman, Claire>very interesting one.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4479-0
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:35.070
<v Westman, Claire>And that is a very good comment.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4483-0
00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.540
<v Westman, Claire>So thank you very much.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4491-0
00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:41.375
<v Westman, Claire>I think that's something that everybody
should kind of think about.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4491-1
00:33:41.375 --> 00:33:42.220
<v Westman, Claire>Is it possible?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4496-0
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:45.910
<v Westman, Claire>To move away from.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4523-0
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:53.383
<v Westman, Claire>Or or to sort of not rely on Western
philosophy, at least at this stage.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4523-1
00:33:53.383 --> 00:33:57.430
<v Westman, Claire>Is it possible to only look at African
philosophy?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4537-0
00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:04.027
<v Westman, Claire>Because if we think about things like
epistemology, metaphysics, ontology,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4537-1
00:34:04.027 --> 00:34:05.750
<v Westman, Claire>a lot of those ideas.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4573-0
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:12.019
<v Westman, Claire>Most of those sort of frameworks or
theories stem from Western philosophy,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4573-1
00:34:12.019 --> 00:34:16.797
<v Westman, Claire>or at least we learn them through a
western philosophical lens,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4573-2
00:34:16.797 --> 00:34:20.380
<v Westman, Claire>because that's what we have written
records of.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4582-0
00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.140
<v Westman, Claire>So there are many arguments about that.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4586-0
00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.460
<v Westman, Claire>But again, we won't go into that.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4607-0
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.705
<v Westman, Claire>But can we even do African philosophy,
let's say,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4607-1
00:34:28.705 --> 00:34:32.740
<v Westman, Claire>without having that foundation that we
gain from Western philosophy?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4613-0
00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:36.500
<v Westman, Claire>So that's something for you to think
about very carefully.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4616-0
00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:38.750
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4619-0
00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:39.190
<v Westman, Claire>Oh yes.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4624-0
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:40.630
<v Westman, Claire>And then the next comment.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4627-0
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:43.870
<v Westman, Claire>Western philosophy did dilute African
culture.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4629-0
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:45.070
<v Westman, Claire>Yes, absolutely.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4649-0
00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:53.484
<v Westman, Claire>The the arrival of colonizers diluted and
distorted and impacted so greatly upon</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4649-1
00:34:53.484 --> 00:34:54.790
<v Westman, Claire>African culture.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4671-0
00:34:55.740 --> 00:35:01.066
<v Westman, Claire>And so it's also even difficult to know
now what traditions, beliefs,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4671-1
00:35:01.066 --> 00:35:03.500
<v Westman, Claire>cultures were like pre colonial.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4679-0
00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.793
<v Westman, Claire>Again,
because a lot of it has been handed down</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4679-1
00:35:06.793 --> 00:35:07.220
<v Westman, Claire>orally.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4687-0
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.470
<v Westman, Claire>And over time, so a lot of it has changed.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4700-0
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:18.220
<v Westman, Claire>I'm just gonna mute everybody.
Somebody's mark is on.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4698-0
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:18.020
<v CASHENY LAMOLA>Yeah.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4712-0
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.820
<v Westman, Claire>I do see your. I did see your hand up,
but I see it's down now.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4717-0
00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:26.510
<v Westman, Claire>Sorry, let me just go back here.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4756-0
00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:32.505
<v Westman, Claire>If you argue that it's not ethically
desirable for Western philosophy to</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4756-1
00:35:32.505 --> 00:35:36.147
<v Westman, Claire>maintain its dominance,
are you meant to argue that it's rather</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4756-2
00:35:36.147 --> 00:35:39.391
<v Westman, Claire>ethically desirable that African
philosophy is dominant,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4756-3
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:40.870
<v Westman, Claire>or that neither should be?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4758-0
00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.380
<v Westman, Claire>You can't, yes.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4781-0
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:47.140
<v Westman, Claire>So again,
you can say that neither should be</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4781-1
00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.656
<v Westman, Claire>dominant,
that there should be a balance between</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4781-2
00:35:50.656 --> 00:35:53.670
<v Westman, Claire>Western philosophy and African philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4824-0
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:59.252
<v Westman, Claire>You can absolutely argue that you don't
have to say just because you say Western</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4824-1
00:35:59.252 --> 00:36:02.973
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy shouldn't be dominant.
African philosophy,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4824-2
00:36:02.973 --> 00:36:06.005
<v Westman, Claire>should you do not have to say that you
can.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4824-3
00:36:06.005 --> 00:36:10.070
<v Westman, Claire>But you can say African philosophy and
Western philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4830-0
00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.860
<v Westman, Claire>Should both be valued.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4855-0
00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:16.389
<v Westman, Claire>There should be a balance between them
because both of them bring value to the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4855-1
00:36:16.389 --> 00:36:19.140
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy departments to philosophy
discourse.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4860-0
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.460
<v Westman, Claire>Both of them have important knowledge.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4868-0
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:26.390
<v Westman, Claire>That can be imparted. OK,
so I hope that answers the question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4872-0
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:28.630
<v Westman, Claire>Question one.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4879-0
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.870
<v Westman, Claire>Can only use the study guide for
reference.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4898-0
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:35.835
<v Westman, Claire>You can only use the study guide if you
find the information in there is all that</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4898-1
00:36:35.835 --> 00:36:39.110
<v Westman, Claire>you need in order to answer the question.
So remember.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4903-0
00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.900
<v Westman, Claire>The study guide is your main source.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4921-0
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:48.553
<v Westman, Claire>So you must reference the study guide if
you want to look for other sources,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4921-1
00:36:48.553 --> 00:36:50.390
<v Westman, Claire>because you need more information.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4928-0
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.390
<v Westman, Claire>Than you are.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4969-0
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:56.340
<v Westman, Claire>You can do that,
but if you find for this assignment that</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4969-1
00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:01.107
<v Westman, Claire>the study guide is all you need,
then you can just focus on the study</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4969-2
00:37:01.107 --> 00:37:05.534
<v Westman, Claire>guide for assessment two.
You will need to look at other sources</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4969-3
00:37:05.534 --> 00:37:08.870
<v Westman, Claire>and include evidence from other sources
as well.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4976-0
00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.580
<v Westman, Claire>OK, how can you reference me?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4994-0
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.814
<v Westman, Claire>You can reference the recording if you
want to,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/4994-1
00:37:19.814 --> 00:37:24.260
<v Westman, Claire>but also remember a lot of these ideas
come from the study guide.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5011-0
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.979
<v Westman, Claire>And if you do research,
you will also find a lot of these ideas</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5011-1
00:37:29.979 --> 00:37:31.150
<v Westman, Claire>in the research, OK?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5016-0
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:34.510
<v Westman, Claire>So these are my necessary my ideas.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5035-0
00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:39.791
<v Westman, Claire>They are ideas that you will also find in
in research,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5035-1
00:37:39.791 --> 00:37:43.070
<v Westman, Claire>but you can reference the recording if
you like.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5066-0
00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:52.208
<v Westman, Claire>Can you argue that Western philosophy
taught on the African continent has been</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5066-1
00:37:52.208 --> 00:37:56.486
<v Westman, Claire>influenced by African culture?
Given given the forces amalgamation of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5066-2
00:37:56.486 --> 00:37:58.380
<v Westman, Claire>indigenous with the colonizers?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5067-0
00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.660
<v Westman, Claire>Yes, absolutely.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5089-0
00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:04.881
<v Westman, Claire>So if you want to argue that Western
philosophy has been when it was brought</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5089-1
00:38:04.881 --> 00:38:09.220
<v Westman, Claire>to the African continent,
it was influenced by African culture.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5102-0
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:14.027
<v Westman, Claire>It has been influenced by indigenous
knowledge systems or African knowledge</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5102-1
00:38:14.027 --> 00:38:14.670
<v Westman, Claire>and beliefs.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5116-0
00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:19.682
<v Westman, Claire>You can argue that that's a very
interesting point as well.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5116-1
00:38:19.682 --> 00:38:21.020
<v Westman, Claire>So remember again.</v>

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:27.663
<v Westman, Claire>You can develop any argument that you
feel answers those questions,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5159-1
00:38:27.663 --> 00:38:33.468
<v Westman, Claire>or any that does answer those questions.
As long as you show how you got to that</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5159-2
00:38:33.468 --> 00:38:36.764
<v Westman, Claire>argument.
As long as you've got the reference</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5159-3
00:38:36.764 --> 00:38:39.630
<v Westman, Claire>evidence in there to support your claim.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5161-0
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:39.980
<v Westman, Claire>S.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5168-0
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:45.350
<v Westman, Claire>Can I reference a YouTube video?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5182-0
00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:50.163
<v Westman, Claire>You can reference a YouTube video.
Just make sure that it is a credible</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5182-1
00:38:50.163 --> 00:38:50.630
<v Westman, Claire>source.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5196-0
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:54.790
<v Westman, Claire>So there are for example,
some that are done by professors.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5200-0
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:58.030
<v Westman, Claire>In philosophy,
there are some that are done by.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5206-0
00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:00.990
<v Westman, Claire>Sort of learning institution.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5209-0
00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:02.950
<v Westman, Claire>So make sure it's those OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5227-0
00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:10.025
<v Westman, Claire>Can we agree African philosophy should be
dominant in African communities and not</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5227-1
00:39:10.025 --> 00:39:10.950
<v Westman, Claire>all over the world?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5230-0
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.430
<v Westman, Claire>Again, yes, you can do that.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5252-0
00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:17.380
<v Westman, Claire>Because again,
if we're saying we're looking at</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5252-1
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:23.080
<v Westman, Claire>challenges in, let's say, for example,
Ukraine, because they, you know,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5252-2
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.900
<v Westman, Claire>in a war at the moment.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5268-0
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.830
<v Westman, Claire>The information the knowledge from Africa,
maybe we could say is not really relevant</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5268-1
00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:30.510
<v Westman, Claire>to their context.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5293-0
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:37.390
<v Westman, Claire>Theirs is more sort of Eastern European
philosophy or European philosophy is more</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5293-1
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:40.450
<v Westman, Claire>relevant to them.
So you might say that in Africa,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5293-2
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:41.590
<v Westman, Claire>African philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5295-0
00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:43.580
<v Westman, Claire>Should.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5300-0
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.100
<v Westman, Claire>Dominant but not everywhere.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5302-0
00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.560
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5308-0
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:55.390
<v Westman, Claire>Some really, really good points here.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5324-0
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:04.003
<v Westman, Claire>Yes.
So another very good point here from</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5324-1
00:40:04.003 --> 00:40:05.510
<v Westman, Claire>Allison at the end.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5335-0
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:08.366
<v Westman, Claire>African philosophy existed before Western
philosophy,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5335-1
00:40:08.366 --> 00:40:10.270
<v Westman, Claire>but there's no written record of it.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5337-0
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:12.150
<v Westman, Claire>Very, very good point.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5340-0
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.790
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5360-0
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:17.313
<v Westman, Claire>Let me just I'm not going to go through
everything because we're running out of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5360-1
00:40:17.313 --> 00:40:19.470
<v Westman, Claire>time already.
Do we have to have a bibliography?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5375-0
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:24.298
<v Westman, Claire>Three, yes, absolutely.
In text referencing and bibliography,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5375-1
00:40:24.298 --> 00:40:27.980
<v Westman, Claire>is it OK to paraphrase information from
AI? No.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5381-0
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:32.150
<v Westman, Claire>Reference AI no, OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5412-0
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.755
<v Westman, Claire>The university has a strict policy
against using AI.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5412-1
00:40:38.755 --> 00:40:44.385
<v Westman, Claire>You can use AI maybe to give you an idea
of how you want to structure your answer,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5412-2
00:40:44.385 --> 00:40:46.080
<v Westman, Claire>what you want to include.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5417-0
00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.920
<v Westman, Claire>But AI is very unreliable.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5429-0
00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:56.160
<v Westman, Claire>Still so often it will give you very
vague information.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5433-0
00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.920
<v Westman, Claire>Sometimes it gives you incorrect
information.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5448-0
00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:03.150
<v Westman, Claire>So there are many, many,
many sources that you can use.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5451-0
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:04.830
<v Westman, Claire>So please don't rely on AI.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5474-0
00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:09.060
<v Westman, Claire>It's like Wikipedia.
You can use it as a starting point to</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5474-1
00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:13.180
<v Westman, Claire>give you if you don't know anything about
the topic, you can use it as an idea.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5501-0
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:18.958
<v Westman, Claire>Of sort of help you get an idea of the
topic to help you sort of get your mind</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5501-1
00:41:18.958 --> 00:41:21.392
<v Westman, Claire>around it,
to think about how to structure your</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5501-2
00:41:21.392 --> 00:41:21.950
<v Westman, Claire>assignment.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5513-0
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:27.670
<v Westman, Claire>But you should not be actually taking
information from an AR source, OK?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5526-0
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:31.353
<v Westman, Claire>So be very, very careful of that.
And for example, in assignment two,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5526-1
00:41:31.353 --> 00:41:32.510
<v Westman, Claire>when you use turnitin.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5536-0
00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.340
<v Westman, Claire>It picks up if you've used AI OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5549-0
00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:44.176
<v Westman, Claire>So it's very it's a contentious topic,
but please rather look for good</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5549-1
00:41:44.176 --> 00:41:45.500
<v Westman, Claire>information.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5560-0
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:50.780
<v Westman, Claire>Anything that you find on an AR source is
going to be in a credible source.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5581-0
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:56.311
<v Westman, Claire>So my suggestion is also you can start
with the AR to get an idea,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5581-1
00:41:56.311 --> 00:41:59.460
<v Westman, Claire>but go look for those credible sources.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5588-0
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:02.350
<v Westman, Claire>That then help you to back up that
information.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5599-0
00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:09.420
<v Westman, Claire>And make sure you're referencing the
credible sources, OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5606-0
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.820
<v Westman, Claire>You can if you if you OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5610-0
00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:13.700
<v Westman, Claire>It's no OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5624-0
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:17.159
<v Westman, Claire>It's very tricky and it's beyond the
scope of this meeting,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5624-1
00:42:17.159 --> 00:42:19.580
<v Westman, Claire>so I'll just leave it at that for now, OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5631-0
00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.440
<v Westman, Claire>Yes, that's what I'm saying.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5657-0
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:32.145
<v Westman, Claire>Is that you can use AI as a way to help
you start off your understanding,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5657-1
00:42:32.145 --> 00:42:39.574
<v Westman, Claire>but it's not the information you should
not be actually using that information in</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5657-2
00:42:39.574 --> 00:42:40.480
<v Westman, Claire>your work.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5672-0
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:45.771
<v Westman, Claire>You use it to give you a general first
idea of what the topic is about,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5672-1
00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:46.560
<v Westman, Claire>so you can.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5677-0
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.960
<v Westman, Claire>It's the same as Wikipedia.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5683-0
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.320
<v Westman, Claire>You cannot reference Wikipedia in.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5688-0
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:52.270
<v Westman, Claire>Academic work. It's not academic.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5719-0
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:57.891
<v Westman, Claire>Anybody can write anything on there,
but you can go read Wikipedia to get an</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5719-1
00:42:57.891 --> 00:43:02.878
<v Westman, Claire>idea of what the topic is about and then
go look at the sources that Wikipedia</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5719-2
00:43:02.878 --> 00:43:05.150
<v Westman, Claire>gives you and go find those sources.</v>

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:10.569

00:43:10.569 --> 00:43:11.190
<v Westman, Claire>your answer.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5759-0
00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:16.349
<v Westman, Claire>What kind of point you might include,
but then when you're referencing in your</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5759-1
00:43:16.349 --> 00:43:18.819
<v Westman, Claire>work,
the work you include as referenced</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5759-2
00:43:18.819 --> 00:43:21.590
<v Westman, Claire>evidence needs to come from academic

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5790-0
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:28.028

00:43:28.028 --> 00:43:33.100
<v Westman, Claire>you can give credit to the AI source that
you use, but it is very.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5807-0
00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:43.519
<v Westman, Claire>It is a tricky situation right now,
so I would suggest avoid AI as much as</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5807-1
00:43:43.519 --> 00:43:44.500
<v Westman, Claire>possible.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5835-0
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:49.094
<v Westman, Claire>Just because what ends up happening is
people submit fully AR answers,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5835-1
00:43:49.094 --> 00:43:54.289
<v Westman, Claire>and then you're going to get 0OK if you
submit an answer that has been generated</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5835-2
00:43:54.289 --> 00:43:55.700
<v Westman, Claire>by AI, you will get 0.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5844-0
00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:58.630
<v Westman, Claire>Somebody's mic is on, I think.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5848-0
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:59.790
<v Westman, Claire>Let me just check again.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5856-0
00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:03.027
<v Westman, Claire>I keep muting them all,
but people obviously keep unmuting</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5856-1
00:44:03.027 --> 00:44:03.630
<v Westman, Claire>themselves.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5859-0
00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:06.890
<v Westman, Claire>Beverly, your hand is up.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5864-0
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:13.830
<v Westman, Claire>You can unmute yourself.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5866-0
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:20.490
<v Westman, Claire>Beverly.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5876-0
00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:30.210
<v Westman, Claire>Yes, you can use AI as a planning tool.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5879-0
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:31.490
<v Westman, Claire>OK, Beverly.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5881-0
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:34.370
<v Westman, Claire>Was it an accidental hand? OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5884-0
00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.140
<v Westman, Claire>We are running out of time.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5892-0
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:41.740
<v Westman, Claire>We still have a lot to do,
so let's continue, but very good points.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5897-0
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:43.550
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5917-0
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:48.550
<v Westman, Claire>I've mentioned the declaration letter so
many times, there is a button,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5917-1
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:52.230
<v Westman, Claire>a block that you click when you open the
assignment.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5919-0
00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:54.420
<v Westman, Claire>That.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5957-0
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.583
<v Westman, Claire>Says that you declare honesty blah blah.
You click that,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5957-1
00:44:58.583 --> 00:45:02.350
<v Westman, Claire>but that little block it won't let you
submit the assignments until you click</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5957-2
00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:04.571
<v Westman, Claire>that block.
That is your honesty declaration,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5957-3
00:45:04.571 --> 00:45:07.710
<v Westman, Claire>so you don't need to include an actual
letter in the assignment.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5959-0
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.910
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5961-0
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:12.070
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5978-0
00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:18.157
<v Westman, Claire>So let's move on to the next question
because this one is a bit trickier,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5978-1
00:45:18.157 --> 00:45:20.260
<v Westman, Claire>and yet we're running out of time.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/5985-0
00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.740
<v Westman, Claire>So let's get to this quickly.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6016-0
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:26.164
<v Westman, Claire>So this question says,
drawing on the knowledge you have gained</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6016-1
00:45:26.164 --> 00:45:29.652
<v Westman, Claire>about metaphysics,
which means obviously you first need to</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6016-2
00:45:29.652 --> 00:45:33.140
<v Westman, Claire>go and get an understanding of metaph
what metaphysics is.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6031-0
00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:38.900
<v Westman, Claire>Explain why the Elysian philosophers
should be called metaphysicians.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6036-0
00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.620
<v Westman, Claire>You can refer to unit two of the study
guide.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6057-0
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:46.046
<v Westman, Claire>So again,
this is asking you about metaphysics,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6057-1
00:45:46.046 --> 00:45:49.950
<v Westman, Claire>and it's asking you about the malesian
philosophers.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6066-0
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:55.590
<v Westman, Claire>So the pre Socratic philosophers and it
needs you to explain.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6099-0
00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:00.121
<v Westman, Claire>Why?
It could be said that malesian</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6099-1
00:46:00.121 --> 00:46:03.372
<v Westman, Claire>philosophers fell under the bracket of
metaphysics,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6099-2
00:46:03.372 --> 00:46:07.310
<v Westman, Claire>while the philosophy they did could be
considered metaphysics.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6101-0
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:09.390
<v Westman, Claire>So in order to answer this question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6104-0
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.790
<v Westman, Claire>You first need to.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6112-0
00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.340
<v Westman, Claire>Explain what metaphysics is.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6118-0
00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:18.020
<v Westman, Claire>You first need to understand what
metaphysics is so.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6149-0
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:25.671
<v Westman, Claire>Just as a note for this question,
you will need to look at Pages 8 to 10 of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6149-1
00:46:25.671 --> 00:46:30.843
<v Westman, Claire>the study guide because that tells you a
little bit about epistemology and</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6149-2
00:46:30.843 --> 00:46:31.670
<v Westman, Claire>metaphysics.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6161-0
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:37.221
<v Westman, Claire>But you will probably need to go do your
own bit of research about metaphysics for</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6161-1
00:46:37.221 --> 00:46:38.110
<v Westman, Claire>this question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6167-0
00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:40.230
<v Westman, Claire>But page 8 to 10 of the study guide.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6185-0
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:47.160
<v Westman, Claire>And then the information about the
Malaysian philosophers is on page 23 to</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6185-1
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:47.400
<v Westman, Claire>31.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6208-0
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:53.686
<v Westman, Claire>So that's the focus for of the study
guide for this question. For question one,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6208-1
00:46:53.686 --> 00:46:59.275
<v Westman, Claire>I didn't mention this then 12 pages 12 to
21 are where you should focus your</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6208-2
00:46:59.275 --> 00:47:00.000
<v Westman, Claire>attention.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6214-0
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.150
<v Westman, Claire>For question one, OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6217-0
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:05.470
<v Westman, Claire>So there's a hand up Luanda.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6231-0
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:12.795
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>Yeah. Sorry, ma'am.
I just missed the second set of pages for</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6231-1
00:47:12.795 --> 00:47:13.670
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>mesophysics.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6233-0
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:14.800
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6238-0
00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.600
<v Westman, Claire>So it's pages 8 to 10.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6248-0
00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:21.870
<v Westman, Claire>And pages 23 to 31.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6243-0
00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:19.020
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6250-0
00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:23.850
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6253-0
00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:24.610
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>Thank you.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6254-0
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:25.310
<v Westman, Claire>It's a pleasure.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6268-0
00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:31.310
<v Westman, Claire>OK,
so to define metaphysics is quite tricky.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6283-0
00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:35.790
<v Westman, Claire>There's no single definition of
metaphysics, and it's changed over time.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6293-0
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:40.910
<v Westman, Claire>So what might have been considered
metaphysics at one point?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6312-0
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:43.938
<v Westman, Claire>So sort of.
During the ancient Greek philosoph</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6312-1
00:47:43.938 --> 00:47:47.030
<v Westman, Claire>philosophers time,
it sort of changed somewhat.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6332-0
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:50.900
<v Westman, Claire>Some of it is the same.
There's been sort of additional ideas of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6332-1
00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.590
<v Westman, Claire>what constitutes metaphysics or what
falls under metaphysics.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6338-0
00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:56.940
<v Westman, Claire>So it has changed over time.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6378-0
00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:02.620
<v Westman, Claire>So this is 1 aspect of this question that
might be a little bit tricky for you,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6378-1
00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:08.442
<v Westman, Claire>but let's look at some of the definitions
that we can find through doing a bit of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6378-2
00:48:08.442 --> 00:48:13.696
<v Westman, Claire>research on the Internet so metaphysics
can generally most generally it's</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6378-3
00:48:13.696 --> 00:48:15.470
<v Westman, Claire>understood as OK, I hope.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6385-0
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:15.740
<v Westman, Claire>You can hear me.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6390-0
00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.460
<v Westman, Claire>There's a weed eater that's really loud
outside.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6407-0
00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:25.571
<v Westman, Claire>It's generally understood as the branch
of philosophy that examines the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6407-1
00:48:25.571 --> 00:48:27.500
<v Westman, Claire>fundamental nature of reality.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6415-0
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:31.030
<v Westman, Claire>There's another hand.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6420-0
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:35.110
<v Westman, Claire>Arpa C is a question for now.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6423-0
00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:37.150
<v Westman, Claire>Oh, OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6429-0
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:39.110
<v Westman, Claire>I'm going to come back to questions at
the end.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6433-0
00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:39.430
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6441-0
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:43.190
<v Westman, Claire>So let's just get through this and then
we'll deal with questions at the end.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6459-0
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:50.137
<v Westman, Claire>So it's generally the branch of
philosophy that examines fundamental</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6459-1
00:48:50.137 --> 00:48:51.030
<v Westman, Claire>nature of reality.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6469-0
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:54.900
<v Westman, Claire>So what do we understand by reality?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6473-0
00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.940
<v Westman, Claire>What sort of things are real?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6480-0
00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:59.820
<v Westman, Claire>What do we know about what's real?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6515-0
00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:06.152
<v Westman, Claire>So other definitions that might make this
a bit clearer for you are it's the study</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6515-1
00:49:06.152 --> 00:49:10.688
<v Westman, Claire>of the nature of reality or of what sort
of things are real,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6515-2
00:49:10.688 --> 00:49:16.636
<v Westman, Claire>but seeks to understand basic criteria or
first principles for determining what</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6515-3
00:49:16.636 --> 00:49:18.420
<v Westman, Claire>sort of things are real.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6523-0
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:21.630
<v Westman, Claire>So it can address topics such as space
and time.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6550-0
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:26.519
<v Westman, Claire>Time determinism and free will,
God minded matter,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6550-1
00:49:26.519 --> 00:49:33.425
<v Westman, Claire>identity and change and more so you can
see it's very broad metaphysics and we</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6550-2
00:49:33.425 --> 00:49:35.260
<v Westman, Claire>know it incorporates.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6557-0
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:38.030
<v Westman, Claire>Other branches of philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6573-0
00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:45.010
<v Westman, Claire>Another definition says it is the science
that studies being as such,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6573-1
00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:47.230
<v Westman, Claire>or the first causes of things.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6583-0
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:50.822
<v Westman, Claire>So now some of these things I've
highlighted will be important for this</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6583-1
00:49:50.822 --> 00:49:51.270
<v Westman, Claire>question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6588-0
00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:54.410
<v Westman, Claire>Or things that do not change.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6616-0
00:49:55.830 --> 00:50:00.632
<v Westman, Claire>The final one I've got here is it's a
division of philosophy that is concerned</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6616-1
00:50:00.632 --> 00:50:03.670
<v Westman, Claire>with the fundamental nature of reality
and being.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6621-0
00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:08.750
<v Westman, Claire>It includes ontology,
cosmology and often epistemology.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6635-0
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:15.270
<v Westman, Claire>It's a study of what is outside objective
experience, so it's trying to understand.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6642-0
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:21.070
<v Westman, Claire>What? What constitutes reality?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6644-0
00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:22.900
<v Westman, Claire>What things are real?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6651-0
00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:26.790
<v Westman, Claire>What makes up those things that are real?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6666-0
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:32.460
<v Westman, Claire>What are the sort of substances that we
can understand for things that are real,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6666-1
00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:32.670
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6668-0
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:34.670
<v Westman, Claire>So what makes up our reality?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6704-0
00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:41.213
<v Westman, Claire>And very importantly,
here is to take note of things like the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6704-1
00:50:41.213 --> 00:50:45.758
<v Westman, Claire>first causes of things,
because as we are going to see,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6704-2
00:50:45.758 --> 00:50:52.332
<v Westman, Claire>that is the focus of Malaysian philosophy
was trying to understand the causes of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6704-3
00:50:52.332 --> 00:50:52.900
<v Westman, Claire>things.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6714-0
00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:59.060
<v Westman, Claire>So what is it that causes something to be
something to exist?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6730-0
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:05.180
<v Westman, Claire>How do we understand the world that we
are living in? How do we understand?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6735-0
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:07.820
<v Westman, Claire>The things around us.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6749-0
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.740
<v Westman, Claire>How how do we understand the fundamental
nature?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6757-0
00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:17.740
<v Westman, Claire>So what is it that gives things the
fundamental nature?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6768-0
00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:21.023
<v Westman, Claire>What?
What is the substance that makes things</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6768-1
00:51:21.023 --> 00:51:23.020
<v Westman, Claire>real or gives us our nature?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6771-0
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:25.630
<v Westman, Claire>Gives us reality.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6782-0
00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:30.490
<v Westman, Claire>So go and do some research on metaphysics.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6787-0
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:32.770
<v Westman, Claire>And there are also lots of videos that
you can watch.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6793-0
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:37.130
<v Westman, Claire>That will help you, OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6829-0
00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:42.160
<v Westman, Claire>I've included some suggested sources at
the towards the end of the slides that</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6829-1
00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:46.720
<v Westman, Claire>you can use also to help you. OK,
we are definitely going to go over time</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6829-2
00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:49.987
<v Westman, Claire>here, so I hope that's OK with everybody.
Obviously,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6829-3
00:51:49.987 --> 00:51:53.130
<v Westman, Claire>if you need to leave then you're welcome
to leave.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6840-0
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:59.210
<v Westman, Claire>Hey, catch up on the recording.
Next week's class will be short.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6842-0
00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:00.370
<v Westman, Claire>Because just one question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6846-0
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:01.540
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6851-0
00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:04.140
<v Westman, Claire>So an overview of the Malaysian.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6867-0
00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:11.946
<v Westman, Claire>They called sort of the Ironian school or
the museum because it from they were from</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6867-1
00:52:11.946 --> 00:52:12.580
<v Westman, Claire>Malaysia.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6880-0
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.940
<v Westman, Claire>And that was part of Ancient Greece.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6890-0
00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:21.435
<v Westman, Claire>It would actually be part of Turkey now,
but that's not so important for you to</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6890-1
00:52:21.435 --> 00:52:21.940
<v Westman, Claire>know now.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6913-0
00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:29.314
<v Westman, Claire>So the the main thing that the Malaysians
were doing was trying to move away from</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6913-1
00:52:29.314 --> 00:52:30.710
<v Westman, Claire>myth and superstition.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6944-0
00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:36.267
<v Westman, Claire>So there were many mythological
understandings of the nature of the world</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6944-1
00:52:36.267 --> 00:52:41.704
<v Westman, Claire>and of things that we experienced.
They experienced in the world a lot of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6944-2
00:52:41.704 --> 00:52:46.407
<v Westman, Claire>their understanding of those stem from
myth, from superstition,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6944-3
00:52:46.407 --> 00:52:48.390
<v Westman, Claire>from ideas around the gods.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6958-0
00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:53.134
<v Westman, Claire>So the Malaysians were trying to move
away from that to have a more rational</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6958-1
00:52:53.134 --> 00:52:53.860
<v Westman, Claire>understanding.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6988-0
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:59.389
<v Westman, Claire>Of what they were experiencing or the
things they could observe,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/6988-1
00:52:59.389 --> 00:53:04.930
<v Westman, Claire>the patterns they could observe that were
happening around them in the world.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7002-0
00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:08.624
<v Westman, Claire>So, for example,
myth had been used to explain many</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7002-1
00:53:08.624 --> 00:53:12.050
<v Westman, Claire>natural phenomena. Let's say,
for example Thunder.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7025-0
00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:20.395
<v Westman, Claire>Mythologically or during those times it
might have been explained that Thunder</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7025-1
00:53:20.395 --> 00:53:23.700
<v Westman, Claire>was caused by God's the various gods
anger.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7028-0
00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:24.410
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7032-0
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:26.530
<v Westman, Claire>So that's where Thunder might have come
from.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7045-0
00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.940
<v Westman, Claire>They had many gods to explain the
different natural phenomena.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7085-0
00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:37.203
<v Westman, Claire>So the Malaysians wanted to have these
more rational moving towards scientific</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7085-1
00:53:37.203 --> 00:53:41.599
<v Westman, Claire>understandings of an explanations for
national natural phenomena.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7085-2
00:53:41.599 --> 00:53:45.063
<v Westman, Claire>So for example,
they could see that there was these</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7085-3
00:53:45.063 --> 00:53:47.860
<v Westman, Claire>patterns like the tides coming in and out.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7088-0
00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:49.180
<v Westman, Claire>So they didn't.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7100-0
00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:53.740
<v Westman, Claire>They thought that there was rational
explanations for why the tides came in</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7100-1
00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:54.220
<v Westman, Claire>and out.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7135-0
00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:57.367
<v Westman, Claire>Out,
rather than saying that it was because of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7135-1
00:53:57.367 --> 00:54:01.230
<v Westman, Claire>the gods or some other,
some other kind of superstitious reason</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7135-2
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:04.610
<v Westman, Claire>or mythological reason that the tides
moved in and out,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7135-3
00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:08.170
<v Westman, Claire>they wanted to have a more rational
understanding of that.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7170-0
00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:13.448
<v Westman, Claire>You know,
they might have also seen the crops grew</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7170-1
00:54:13.448 --> 00:54:17.518
<v Westman, Claire>at certain times of the year where in
mythologically that might have been that</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7170-2
00:54:17.518 --> 00:54:20.455
<v Westman, Claire>would have been attributed to one of the
gods, you know,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7170-3
00:54:20.455 --> 00:54:23.700
<v Westman, Claire>blessing the harvest and the crops
sprouting during that time.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7182-0
00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:28.210
<v Westman, Claire>The Malaysian philosophers wanted to
understand what is it?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7199-0
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:35.460
<v Westman, Claire>About nature or these phenomena that
causes the crops to arise at that time.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7208-0
00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:38.740
<v Westman, Claire>So they wanted to develop a more rational
understanding.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7226-0
00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:45.191
<v Westman, Claire>So the fundamental question that the
Malaysians asked is what is the first</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7226-1
00:54:45.191 --> 00:54:48.020
<v Westman, Claire>governing principle of the world by which
chaos.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7235-0
00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:52.220
<v Westman, Claire>Is turned into Cosmos or intelligible
matter.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7246-0
00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:55.210
<v Westman, Claire>So what is the the thing that underlies?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7269-0
00:54:55.210 --> 00:55:00.231
<v Westman, Claire>What is the substance that underlies
everything that gives it?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7269-1
00:55:00.231 --> 00:55:05.330
<v Westman, Claire>That gives patterns that contribute to it
being understandable?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7302-0
00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:10.575
<v Westman, Claire>So going from sort of just seeing all
these wild, random, unintelligible,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7302-1
00:55:10.575 --> 00:55:15.851
<v Westman, Claire>chaotic aspects of nature of natural
phenomena, all these while, you know,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7302-2
00:55:15.851 --> 00:55:19.930
<v Westman, Claire>unformed things happening around us in
the natural world.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7308-0
00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:22.220
<v Westman, Claire>What is the thing that governs that?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7324-0
00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:27.599
<v Westman, Claire>That gives an order that makes it
intelligible that forms it,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7324-1
00:55:27.599 --> 00:55:29.530
<v Westman, Claire>that brings it together.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7354-0
00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:33.181
<v Westman, Claire>So that is what they were trying to
understand.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7354-1
00:55:33.181 --> 00:55:39.146
<v Westman, Claire>So they wanted to understand what it was
that governed observable patterns or from</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7354-2
00:55:39.146 --> 00:55:43.890
<v Westman, Claire>which natural phenomena and consequently
nature of being emerged.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7363-0
00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:47.450
<v Westman, Claire>So they wanted to understand what was the
underlying substance.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7376-0
00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:52.260
<v Westman, Claire>That led to or governed observable
patterns or that led.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7400-0
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:55.943
<v Westman, Claire>Two natural phenomena that they could
observe,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7400-1
00:55:55.943 --> 00:56:01.138
<v Westman, Claire>so they get sought to gain a deeper
understanding of the fundamental nature</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7400-2
00:56:01.138 --> 00:56:01.890
<v Westman, Claire>of reality.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7421-0
00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:06.155
<v Westman, Claire>And so again,
they wanted to look at sort of this</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7421-1
00:56:06.155 --> 00:56:09.860
<v Westman, Claire>objective thing that was outside of what
they could experience.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7439-0
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:15.230
<v Westman, Claire>So what was it that underlay or
underpinned all of these phenomena that</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7439-1
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:16.340
<v Westman, Claire>they could see?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7449-0
00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:21.192
<v Westman, Claire>And they were generally monists,
which means that they believe all of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7449-1
00:56:21.192 --> 00:56:21.700
<v Westman, Claire>reality.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7461-0
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:25.570
<v Westman, Claire>Is composed of one single unifying
substance.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7464-0
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:28.810
<v Westman, Claire>So we might think that these ideas.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7483-0
00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:33.991
<v Westman, Claire>Are sort of silly now,
or ludicrous when we look at the ideas</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7483-1
00:56:33.991 --> 00:56:35.300
<v Westman, Claire>that they came up with.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7494-0
00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:40.300
<v Westman, Claire>But we must think about the time at which
they were developing these ideas.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7515-0
00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:47.004
<v Westman, Claire>So like I said,
a lot of the understanding of the natural</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7515-1
00:56:47.004 --> 00:56:50.700
<v Westman, Claire>world of the reality was based on myth on.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7517-0
00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:52.980
<v Westman, Claire>Sort of.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7542-0
00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:56.487
<v Westman, Claire>Of thinking that the gods produced the
phenomena,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7542-1
00:56:56.487 --> 00:57:01.666
<v Westman, Claire>they saw that the gods controlled all the
natural phenomena that they could see</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7542-2
00:57:01.666 --> 00:57:03.090
<v Westman, Claire>happening around them.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7562-0
00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:08.446
<v Westman, Claire>And that Malaysians wanted to develop
this more rational idea.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7562-1
00:57:08.446 --> 00:57:10.740
<v Westman, Claire>But it was at a time when not like now.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7575-0
00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:14.780
<v Westman, Claire>And we have scientific explanations for a
lot of what we experience.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7582-0
00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:18.300
<v Westman, Claire>They didn't have those scientific
explanations.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7592-0
00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:23.340
<v Westman, Claire>So when we look at their ideas now,
with the knowledge that we have.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7603-0
00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:28.690
<v Westman, Claire>Now we might think they silly,
but we must think about how important.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7642-0
00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:35.528
<v Westman, Claire>These kind of rational inquiries or these
inquiries towards a more rational</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7642-1
00:57:35.528 --> 00:57:39.398
<v Westman, Claire>explanation,
were at the time and how they helped move</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7642-2
00:57:39.398 --> 00:57:44.534
<v Westman, Claire>knowledge forward and helped to
contribute to sort of scientific inquiry</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7642-3
00:57:44.534 --> 00:57:47.700
<v Westman, Claire>to the development of the scientific
method.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7650-0
00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:52.420
<v Westman, Claire>To developing these objective
understandings.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7675-0
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:59.580
<v Westman, Claire>Of reality of how things work,
of what causes the things that we can see</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7675-1
00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:03.610
<v Westman, Claire>happening around us,
or that we can experience.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7697-0
00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:09.627
<v Westman, Claire>So instead of just our subjective
experiences that we as an individual</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7697-1
00:58:09.627 --> 00:58:13.530
<v Westman, Claire>experience,
what is it that lays the foundation?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7703-0
00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:18.010
<v Westman, Claire>What is the foundation of these things
that everybody experiences?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7709-0
00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:19.820
<v Westman, Claire>In their own way.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7715-0
00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:22.540
<v Westman, Claire>But what causes these phenomena?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7717-0
00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:24.020
<v Westman, Claire>What causes this reality?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7723-0
00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:26.370
<v Westman, Claire>Or this the natural world around us?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7765-0
00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:34.057
<v Westman, Claire>So keep that in mind while you're working
through the Malaysians because as I say</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7765-1
00:58:34.057 --> 00:58:36.909
<v Westman, Claire>to us,
it now seems a bit silly these ideas,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7765-2
00:58:36.909 --> 00:58:41.281
<v Westman, Claire>but at the time this was, you know,
a huge sort of leap in trying to</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7765-3
00:58:41.281 --> 00:58:45.020
<v Westman, Claire>understand the world and trying to
understand reality and.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7777-0
00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:49.980
<v Westman, Claire>To have a better grasp of the nature of
reality, OK?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7785-0
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:54.620
<v Westman, Claire>So the first one,
the first Malaysian we'll get is Thais.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7810-0
00:58:55.850 --> 00:59:01.385
<v Westman, Claire>He was a mathematician and an astronomer,
and he wanted to discover and explain the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7810-1
00:59:01.385 --> 00:59:04.810
<v Westman, Claire>origins,
the material origins of life in the world.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7843-0
00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:10.266
<v Westman, Claire>So he's had made observations of living
things around him,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7843-1
00:59:10.266 --> 00:59:15.375
<v Westman, Claire>and he noted that living things were
either comprised of water or humidity,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7843-2
00:59:15.375 --> 00:59:19.340
<v Westman, Claire>or they needed water or weakness to
survive and to thrive.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7857-0
00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:25.380
<v Westman, Claire>He also, by looking at all of these,
the living things around him noted.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7874-0
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:31.503
<v Westman, Claire>Dying so things living,
things that were dying or dead or</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7874-1
00:59:31.503 --> 00:59:34.650
<v Westman, Claire>inanimate objects, say let's say.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7879-0
00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.740
<v Westman, Claire>What Mark David had a cloth.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7882-0
00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:42.220
<v Westman, Claire>They were.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7889-0
00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:45.180
<v Westman, Claire>They either were dry or they became dry.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7908-0
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.962
<v Westman, Claire>And again,
it'll explain to you in the study guide</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7908-1
00:59:47.962 --> 00:59:51.100
<v Westman, Claire>that at the time they were in a very dry
desert like conditions.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7924-0
00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:55.851
<v Westman, Claire>So water was considered so important it
was considered sort of the thing that</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7924-1
00:59:55.851 --> 00:59:56.460
<v Westman, Claire>gave life.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7946-0
00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:02.389
<v Westman, Claire>So when Thadis was looking at things
around him that were living, he was like,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7946-1
01:00:02.389 --> 01:00:05.168
<v Westman, Claire>OK,
they either are made-up of water or</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7946-2
01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:06.140
<v Westman, Claire>they're humid.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7953-0
01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Westman, Claire>Or they need water.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7957-0
01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.260
<v Westman, Claire>Or some kind of wetness in order to
survive.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7970-0
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:15.610
<v Westman, Claire>So because of these observations he made
about the importance of water.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7983-0
01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:20.460
<v Westman, Claire>He determined that water was the
underlying first principle.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/7993-0
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:26.300
<v Westman, Claire>So he thought that water was what life
originated from.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8009-0
01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:32.495
<v Westman, Claire>From so he thought that water was the
thing that led to the existence of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8009-1
01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:35.850
<v Westman, Claire>everything that was living in the world.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8013-0
01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:36.330
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8021-0
01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:41.290
<v Westman, Claire>So the material origin of life and the
world he thought was water.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8032-0
01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:46.140
<v Westman, Claire>So water formed the foundation of every
living thing he believed.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8050-0
01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:51.025
<v Westman, Claire>And of the world in general. And so,
for example,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8050-1
01:00:51.025 --> 01:00:55.220
<v Westman, Claire>he went so far as to think that the Earth
rested upon water, so he.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8077-0
01:00:55.610 --> 01:01:00.218
<v Westman, Claire>Thought that where earthquakes
mythologically were considered to be the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8077-1
01:01:00.218 --> 01:01:03.802
<v Westman, Claire>anger of the gods,
he thought that earthquakes were the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8077-2
01:01:03.802 --> 01:01:06.490
<v Westman, Claire>result of water rocking beneath the Earth.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8109-0
01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:09.781
<v Westman, Claire>So he thought the earth was on this body
of water,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8109-1
01:01:09.781 --> 01:01:14.621
<v Westman, Claire>and that when the water moved and shook
the earth would rock on top of it.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8109-2
01:01:14.621 --> 01:01:19.203
<v Westman, Claire>And that is what an earthquake was. Again,
we can see that, obviously,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8109-3
01:01:19.203 --> 01:01:20.170
<v Westman, Claire>scientifically.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8121-0
01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:24.740
<v Westman, Claire>We have been geologically,
we've moved far beyond that understanding.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8124-0
01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:29.010
<v Westman, Claire>But we do know that.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8138-0
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:35.100
<v Westman, Claire>But at the time,
this was sort of a revolutionary idea, OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8144-0
01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:40.540
<v Westman, Claire>So for Thales,
the one single unifying substance.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8168-0
01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:48.324
<v Westman, Claire>So the single unifying substance that all
reality is composed of for thalese was</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8168-1
01:01:48.324 --> 01:01:52.740
<v Westman, Claire>water because of the necessity of water
for living things.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8184-0
01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:56.176
<v Westman, Claire>OK.
And then the other natural phenomena</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8184-1
01:01:56.176 --> 01:01:58.170
<v Westman, Claire>could be explained again by water.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8225-0
01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:03.992
<v Westman, Claire>So there are some examples in the study
guide that you can go look at the.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8225-1
01:02:03.992 --> 01:02:08.294
<v Westman, Claire>Also if you go look online,
you can find other examples,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8225-2
01:02:08.294 --> 01:02:14.181
<v Westman, Claire>but for example it was water sprouting
from a spring water rocking the earth,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8225-3
01:02:14.181 --> 01:02:16.370
<v Westman, Claire>creating earthquakes etc. OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8234-0
01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.820
<v Westman, Claire>Anax Amanda is the second one.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8238-0
01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:22.580
<v Westman, Claire>We'll look at so he.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8266-0
01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:29.925
<v Westman, Claire>Went against dailies because remember,
dailies now thought that Earth sat on top</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8266-1
01:02:29.925 --> 01:02:34.533
<v Westman, Claire>of water and anax.
Amanda was actually quite ahead of his</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8266-2
01:02:34.533 --> 01:02:34.930
<v Westman, Claire>time.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8277-0
01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:39.010
<v Westman, Claire>Because he thought that there's nothing
under the Earth supporting it.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8298-0
01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:44.577
<v Westman, Claire>He thought that it floats in the centre
of the universe and that what keeps it</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8298-1
01:02:44.577 --> 01:02:49.090
<v Westman, Claire>floating in the centre of universe is
that it's equal distance from.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8302-0
01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:51.580
<v Westman, Claire>Other worlds other.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8304-0
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:55.260
<v Westman, Claire>Other.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8313-0
01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.120
<v Westman, Claire>On my way, I'm just gonna set obstacles.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8315-0
01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:58.960
<v Westman, Claire>That's not the word.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8336-0
01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:03.151
<v Westman, Claire>Other objects in the universe,
so he thought that it was at an equal</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8336-1
01:03:03.151 --> 01:03:06.250
<v Westman, Claire>distance from other objects which might
have been other worlds.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8355-0
01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:11.914
<v Westman, Claire>And because of that sort of force on the
earth from those other worlds or objects,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8355-1
01:03:11.914 --> 01:03:13.730
<v Westman, Claire>that's what supported that.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8360-0
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:15.930
<v Westman, Claire>What kept the earth floating in the
universe?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8368-0
01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:18.450
<v Westman, Claire>And I mean,
that was such a revolutionary idea.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8378-0
01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:23.242
<v Westman, Claire>And it's, you know,
definitely sort of starting to work</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8378-1
01:03:23.242 --> 01:03:24.610
<v Westman, Claire>towards sort of.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8387-0
01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:27.780
<v Westman, Claire>Ideas of gravity and all of that?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8390-0
01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.740
<v Westman, Claire>But at the time it sort of just.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8396-0
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:31.130
<v Westman, Claire>Kept it simple.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8416-0
01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:37.423
<v Westman, Claire>He also thought that the Earth was sort
of a long tube and that the inhabitable</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8416-1
01:03:37.423 --> 01:03:41.330
<v Westman, Claire>earth was almost like a plate on top of
the tube.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8424-0
01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:46.410
<v Westman, Claire>So again,
you know not a full understanding of.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8439-0
01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:51.864
<v Westman, Claire>The earth, obviously,
but a big leap in what was understood</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8439-1
01:03:51.864 --> 01:03:56.180
<v Westman, Claire>about the Earth or the thinking about the
universe and the earth.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8447-0
01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.740
<v Westman, Claire>So Anax, Amanda didn't think that water.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8456-0
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:04.330
<v Westman, Claire>That was the stylist was his teacher.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8471-0
01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:08.333
<v Westman, Claire>But he didn't think that water was that
what Earth originated from,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8471-1
01:04:08.333 --> 01:04:10.570
<v Westman, Claire>or that everything originated on from.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8489-0
01:04:10.570 --> 01:04:15.248
<v Westman, Claire>Heath thought it was the a pyron,
so the apparent could be understand as</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8489-1
01:04:15.248 --> 01:04:17.170
<v Westman, Claire>infinite unlimited indefinite.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8498-0
01:04:17.170 --> 01:04:20.090
<v Westman, Claire>So you didn't think it was one particular
element?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8510-0
01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:23.983
<v Westman, Claire>Instead,
he thought it was the a pyron which was</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8510-1
01:04:23.983 --> 01:04:26.490
<v Westman, Claire>which he thought was this boundless.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8523-0
01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:32.900
<v Westman, Claire>So just forever reaching expands of
infinitely different substances.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8539-0
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:37.690
<v Westman, Claire>So he thought there was this.
The universe was just this expanse.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8551-0
01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:44.140
<v Westman, Claire>Of substances that could never be
finished would never end.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8570-0
01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:47.428
<v Westman, Claire>So, you know,
like an infinite number and kind of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8570-1
01:04:47.428 --> 01:04:50.780
<v Westman, Claire>substances that could not be created or
destroyed.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8575-0
01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:53.820
<v Westman, Claire>And he thought that everything grew out
of the apyron.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8591-0
01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:00.213
<v Westman, Claire>So, I mean,
we know the universe is sort of infinite</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8591-1
01:05:00.213 --> 01:05:02.540
<v Westman, Claire>and expansive. For him it was.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8620-0
01:05:02.810 --> 01:05:06.026
<v Westman, Claire>Had all these substances and in the world
or earth would come,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8620-1
01:05:06.026 --> 01:05:08.476
<v Westman, Claire>would be a coming together of those
substances,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8620-2
01:05:08.476 --> 01:05:11.130
<v Westman, Claire>that's how the earth would grow out of
the appyron.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8630-0
01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:17.090
<v Westman, Claire>So he thought that the earth that he
inhabited was not.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8644-0
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:23.340
<v Westman, Claire>The only earth and he didn't think our
world would always exist.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8652-0
01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:27.980
<v Westman, Claire>He didn't think it had always existed
because there was a number.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8657-0
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.980
<v Westman, Claire>Of worlds that would.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8675-0
01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:36.940
<v Westman, Claire>Come to exist and then would not always
exist and they would grow out of the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8675-1
01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:37.380
<v Westman, Claire>sapyron.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8689-0
01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:42.260
<v Westman, Claire>So he thought the earth grew out of the
appyron and that it wouldn't always exist.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8698-0
01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.220
<v Westman, Claire>And that other worlds would then grow out
of the apyra.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8712-0
01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:51.300
<v Westman, Claire>And interestingly,
he also started to think about evolution.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8730-0
01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:57.305
<v Westman, Claire>So he thought that the life that he could
observe so the plants, animals, humans,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8730-1
01:05:57.305 --> 01:06:00.381
<v Westman, Claire>etc.
Must have originated from other life</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8730-2
01:06:00.381 --> 01:06:00.820
<v Westman, Claire>forms.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8771-0
01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:06.441
<v Westman, Claire>So he said that the first life forms must
have originated in wetter environments</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8771-1
01:06:06.441 --> 01:06:10.020
<v Westman, Claire>and then evolved into what he what
existed during his time,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8771-2
01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:14.850
<v Westman, Claire>what he could observe and for example,
he thought that humans evolved from fish.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8804-0
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:18.445
<v Westman, Claire>So again,
very revolutionary ideas for the time</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8804-1
01:06:18.445 --> 01:06:23.496
<v Westman, Claire>where everything was attributed to the
gods or myth or superstition.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8804-2
01:06:23.496 --> 01:06:29.060
<v Westman, Claire>He started to have these more sort of
scientific understandings of reality,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8804-3
01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:30.890
<v Westman, Claire>of the nature of reality.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8817-0
01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:37.140
<v Westman, Claire>And this movement towards a sort of
scientific view of the world.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8831-0
01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:44.490
<v Westman, Claire>And then finally, was annex Aminis.
He thought a was the single substance.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8851-0
01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:50.260
<v Westman, Claire>So where we had failies thought it was
water and axaminis thought it was air.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8869-0
01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:53.809
<v Westman, Claire>And he thought that constituted all
things.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8869-1
01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:57.279
<v Westman, Claire>So he said that the change of one thing
into another,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8869-2
01:06:57.279 --> 01:07:00.300
<v Westman, Claire>so the change of anything into something
else.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8882-0
01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.700
<v Westman, Claire>Is simply an indication of a change in
the density of a.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8886-0
01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:07.940
<v Westman, Claire>So for example, he thought that a.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8903-0
01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:12.050
<v Westman, Claire>When it condensed,
it formed clouds and that led to rain.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8917-0
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:16.073
<v Westman, Claire>So a change in the density of air results
in water,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8917-1
01:07:16.073 --> 01:07:18.890
<v Westman, Claire>and again there are some other examples.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8926-0
01:07:19.530 --> 01:07:26.130
<v Westman, Claire>So a lot of these ideas that the
Malaysians gave.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8949-0
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:32.916
<v Westman, Claire>Were not fully explained and you know can
be quite difficult to grasp because they</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8949-1
01:07:32.916 --> 01:07:37.416
<v Westman, Claire>didn't give full explanations,
so not exactly clear why he thought it</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8949-2
01:07:37.416 --> 01:07:38.380
<v Westman, Claire>was air or how.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8954-0
01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:42.250
<v Westman, Claire>You know, air led to everything.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8971-0
01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:47.226
<v Westman, Claire>That exists in reality,
but that was the sort of 1 unifying</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8971-1
01:07:47.226 --> 01:07:49.050
<v Westman, Claire>substance that exists.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/8980-0
01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:54.010
<v Westman, Claire>Thought was what constituted all things
that existed in reality.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9002-0
01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:59.369
<v Westman, Claire>OK,
so for this question you need to have</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9002-1
01:07:59.369 --> 01:08:05.020
<v Westman, Claire>sort of an understanding of those of the
these three malesions.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9010-0
01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:06.700
<v Westman, Claire>You don't need to at this time.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9012-0
01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:08.460
<v Westman, Claire>Look at Pomenetis or Heracles.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9020-0
01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:11.170
<v Westman, Claire>Just these three malesions.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9027-0
01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:14.690
<v Westman, Claire>But then you need to think about, OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9049-0
01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:21.995
<v Westman, Claire>What is it about the kinds of philosoph
philosophical thought that the malesians</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9049-1
01:08:21.995 --> 01:08:25.010
<v Westman, Claire>had that ties back into metaphysics?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9057-0
01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:28.940
<v Westman, Claire>So let's look at this again.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9074-0
01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:33.832
<v Westman, Claire>So if we think about the kinds of
philosophy that they would take that they</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9074-1
01:08:33.832 --> 01:08:36.380
<v Westman, Claire>were engaged in, they were thinking about.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9078-0
01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:38.700
<v Westman, Claire>First principles.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9094-0
01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:45.250
<v Westman, Claire>So while they think about what is real,
what is the fundamental nature of reality?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9103-0
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:50.980
<v Westman, Claire>Very importantly,
sort of the first causes of things or.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9114-0
01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:57.700
<v Westman, Claire>The the governing principles of things.
It involved things like.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9138-0
01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:04.542
<v Westman, Claire>Epistemology and ontology,
which are obviously like what we know and</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9138-1
01:09:04.542 --> 01:09:08.100
<v Westman, Claire>how we know. So. So what,
what exists in the world.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9166-0
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:14.370
<v Westman, Claire>And how do we know about what exists and
also things like cosmology?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9166-1
01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:19.630
<v Westman, Claire>If you think about how they, for example,
an exam thought about how.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9199-0
01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:25.412
<v Westman, Claire>Earth fits into the bigger universe,
so he thought that Earth fits into this</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9199-1
01:09:25.412 --> 01:09:29.683
<v Westman, Claire>bigger universe and Earth grew from this
bigger universe and it existed in a</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9199-2
01:09:29.683 --> 01:09:31.180
<v Westman, Claire>universe with other worlds.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9212-0
01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:36.023
<v Westman, Claire>So that's a kind of a cosmology,
and they were also trying to think of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9212-1
01:09:36.023 --> 01:09:38.660
<v Westman, Claire>what is outside of objective experience.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9223-0
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:44.970
<v Westman, Claire>So what is it that we can explain?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9225-0
01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:46.890
<v Westman, Claire>How can we explain?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9236-0
01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:52.490
<v Westman, Claire>Reality or what is real or or what we
experience and observe.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9245-0
01:09:52.530 --> 01:09:57.450
<v Westman, Claire>How can we explain that on a much sort of
bigger level?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9253-0
01:09:57.490 --> 01:10:01.170
<v Westman, Claire>How can we explain what is at the core?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9268-0
01:10:01.170 --> 01:10:04.196
<v Westman, Claire>What is fundamental to things that are
real,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9268-1
01:10:04.196 --> 01:10:08.970
<v Westman, Claire>and obviously a lot of this has changed
over time from the Malaysians.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9277-0
01:10:08.970 --> 01:10:12.010
<v Westman, Claire>We don't have necessarily the same
understandings.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9279-0
01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:13.290
<v Westman, Claire>We don't think that.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9284-0
01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.820
<v Westman, Claire>All of life springs from water.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9299-0
01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:21.659
<v Westman, Claire>Necessarily,
we also know that not everything is made</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9299-1
01:10:21.659 --> 01:10:23.050
<v Westman, Claire>just from air.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9317-0
01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:29.684
<v Westman, Claire>So some of that has changed.
We know more about sort of the Earth and</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9317-1
01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:33.650
<v Westman, Claire>why it floats and what the earth is
comprised of.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9331-0
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:43.470
<v Westman, Claire>Think about these elements of metaphysics
and how they tie into what the Malaysians.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9345-0
01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:50.050
<v Westman, Claire>Were looking at in their philosophical
inquiries. OK, the origin of the world.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9356-0
01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:53.770
<v Westman, Claire>What? What is the foundation of reality?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9366-0
01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:57.414
<v Westman, Claire>What?
What were the substances that things were</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9366-1
01:10:57.414 --> 01:10:59.690
<v Westman, Claire>made of that made things real?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9374-0
01:11:00.210 --> 01:11:03.930
<v Westman, Claire>So for this question you need to 1st
think about what is metaphysics.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9388-0
01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.295
<v Westman, Claire>Then you need to think about.
You need to give an explanation of what</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9388-1
01:11:09.295 --> 01:11:10.120
<v Westman, Claire>the Malaysians.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9394-0
01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:12.490
<v Westman, Claire>Their their ideas.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9416-0
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:18.309
<v Westman, Claire>And then you need to bring that together
to say based on these understandings of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9416-1
01:11:18.309 --> 01:11:21.770
<v Westman, Claire>metaphysics and these aspects of malesian
thought.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9425-0
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:26.450
<v Westman, Claire>This is why the MALESIANS could be
considered metaphysicians.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9439-0
01:11:26.530 --> 01:11:33.890
<v Westman, Claire>This is why males and philosophical
inquiry could be considered metaphysical.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9449-0
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:37.150
<v Westman, Claire>OK, so I hope that makes sense.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9465-0
01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:41.118
<v Westman, Claire>So some things again you can think about
this might come in later,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9465-1
01:11:41.118 --> 01:11:44.790
<v Westman, Claire>but do you agree with any of the malesion
philosophers ideas?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9489-0
01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:49.776
<v Westman, Claire>Does it show an important step in the
development of philosophical thinking and</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9489-1
01:11:49.776 --> 01:11:50.890
<v Westman, Claire>also scientific thinking?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9498-0
01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:56.010
<v Westman, Claire>And what aspects of metaphysics are
evidence in malesian inquiries?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9500-0
01:11:57.810 --> 01:11:58.330
<v Westman, Claire>OK so.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9509-0
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:03.130
<v Westman, Claire>That's sort of to help you with that
question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9531-0
01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:08.024
<v Westman, Claire>And I know again that it can be quite
tricky to understand,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9531-1
01:12:08.024 --> 01:12:13.412
<v Westman, Claire>especially because it is very different
from our understandings of nature and</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9531-2
01:12:13.412 --> 01:12:14.240
<v Westman, Claire>reality now.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9545-0
01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:19.048
<v Westman, Claire>So again,
please use any resources that are</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9545-1
01:12:19.048 --> 01:12:20.330
<v Westman, Claire>available to you.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9555-0
01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:23.462
<v Westman, Claire>Again,
I'll show you some sources that are quite</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9555-1
01:12:23.462 --> 01:12:25.890
<v Westman, Claire>useful, like some good YouTube videos.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9557-0
01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:27.690
<v Westman, Claire>Some.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9563-0
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:32.330
<v Westman, Claire>Websites that give sort of more
simplistic or.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9565-0
01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:34.090
<v Westman, Claire>More.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9595-0
01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:38.908
<v Westman, Claire>Or maybe even more detailed explanations
that you can use to help you. OK,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9595-1
01:12:38.908 --> 01:12:43.335
<v Westman, Claire>so let me just look at the chat quickly.
If you write more than 300 words,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9595-2
01:12:43.335 --> 01:12:47.880
<v Westman, Claire>Please remember to make sure that
everything you have included is necessary.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9620-0
01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:53.819
<v Westman, Claire>Um,
you can go a little bit over 300 words,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9620-1
01:12:53.819 --> 01:12:59.343
<v Westman, Claire>but if it's too much over then it's
likely that you've included too much</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9620-2
01:12:59.343 --> 01:13:00.250
<v Westman, Claire>information.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9628-0
01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:02.690
<v Westman, Claire>Only focus on the most important
information.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9631-0
01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:06.410
<v Westman, Claire>OK so.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9643-0
01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:11.294
<v Westman, Claire>For this question says,
should we use a meaning that's five or</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9643-1
01:13:11.294 --> 01:13:12.050
<v Westman, Claire>ten years recent?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9655-0
01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:17.360
<v Westman, Claire>I assume you mean for the definition for
metaphysics, so.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9662-0
01:13:18.850 --> 01:13:21.250
<v Westman, Claire>In philosophy, well in most studies.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9674-0
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:26.009
<v Westman, Claire>Sorry,
in most studies we would say used</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9674-1
01:13:26.009 --> 01:13:28.010
<v Westman, Claire>information that is recent.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9688-0
01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:32.726
<v Westman, Claire>However,
we must remember that philosophy stems</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9688-1
01:13:32.726 --> 01:13:33.050
<v Westman, Claire>back.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9700-0
01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:36.041
<v Westman, Claire>Well,
you know this sort of philosophy we're</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9700-1
01:13:36.041 --> 01:13:38.690
<v Westman, Claire>looking at stems back like over 2000
years.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9707-0
01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:42.650
<v Westman, Claire>So you're not always going to be using
very recent sources.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9713-0
01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.560
<v Westman, Claire>You will at times be using very old
sources.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9744-0
01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:50.860
<v Westman, Claire>So when you look up definitions or
information,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9744-1
01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:56.313
<v Westman, Claire>you can see if there's more recent ones,
but it's also not a huge issue in</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9744-2
01:13:56.313 --> 01:13:58.930
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy if you use older sources.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9759-0
01:13:59.170 --> 01:14:01.630
<v Westman, Claire>OK.
Obviously if it's about things that are</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9759-1
01:14:01.630 --> 01:14:03.810
<v Westman, Claire>this is about ancient Greek philosophy.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9775-0
01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:09.188
<v Westman, Claire>So you you would still look for more
recent information because new ideas come</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9775-1
01:14:09.188 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Westman, Claire>along and new interpretations,
but it's not.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9784-0
01:14:13.210 --> 01:14:15.370
<v Westman, Claire>100% necessary to use newer sources.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9791-0
01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.560
<v Westman, Claire>So you can use older sources as well.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9813-0
01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:23.390
<v Westman, Claire>If you're doing something like about AI
ethics,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9813-1
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:28.610
<v Westman, Claire>you obviously want to look at new sources,
because AI is changing all of the time.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9846-0
01:14:28.650 --> 01:14:32.155
<v Westman, Claire>But when looking at things like ancient
Greek philosophy,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9846-1
01:14:32.155 --> 01:14:35.176
<v Westman, Claire>if you're looking for definitions of
metaphysics,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9846-2
01:14:35.176 --> 01:14:40.010
<v Westman, Claire>you might find sources that are from sort
of 2000, 2005, whatever. That's fine.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9852-0
01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:42.410
<v Westman, Claire>That's not an issue in philosophy, OK?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9870-0
01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:53.610
<v Westman, Claire>There isn't much information about Salis
compared to an ex Amanda and Anis.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9881-0
01:14:54.450 --> 01:14:58.650
<v Westman, Claire>That's quite interesting 'cause.
I actually found quite a lot about daleys.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9896-0
01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:03.344
<v Westman, Claire>So again though, remember,
you don't have to go into a whole lot of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9896-1
01:15:03.344 --> 01:15:03.810
<v Westman, Claire>detail.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9911-0
01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:08.285
<v Westman, Claire>It's only 300 words,
so just make sure that you have the main</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9911-1
01:15:08.285 --> 01:15:10.810
<v Westman, Claire>focus that ties into this question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9914-0
01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:12.490
<v Westman, Claire>So when you research these.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9921-0
01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:13.650
<v Westman, Claire>Malesions, you'll see.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9925-0
01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:15.690
<v Westman, Claire>There's a lot of information about other
kinds of.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9941-0
01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:22.559
<v Westman, Claire>Philosophical inquiry that they did other
things that they looked at related to,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9941-1
01:15:22.559 --> 01:15:23.400
<v Westman, Claire>for example.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9957-0
01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:29.294
<v Westman, Claire>I think there's an ex.
Amanda talks about the sun and the moon</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9957-1
01:15:29.294 --> 01:15:30.450
<v Westman, Claire>as disks of fire.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9998-0
01:15:32.290 --> 01:15:36.969
<v Westman, Claire>So some of that is not necessarily
relevant to this discussion or to your</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9998-1
01:15:36.969 --> 01:15:40.003
<v Westman, Claire>answer.
So remember to focus on for now what is</v>

01:15:40.003 --> 01:15:45.314
<v Westman, Claire>most important to helping you answer this
question about how the MALESIONS could be</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/9998-3
01:15:45.314 --> 01:15:47.210
<v Westman, Claire>considered to have been doing.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10002-0
01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.600
<v Westman, Claire>Metaphysics.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10018-0
01:15:51.730 --> 01:15:57.090
<v Westman, Claire>So just try and find information that's
most relevant for this purpose, OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10030-0
01:15:57.130 --> 01:16:01.783
<v Westman, Claire>It's great that you're doing research and
that you're seeing you're finding</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10030-1
01:16:01.783 --> 01:16:03.130
<v Westman, Claire>information fantastic.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10042-0
01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:07.130
<v Westman, Claire>But remember,
when you're writing up your answers to</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10042-1
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:08.850
<v Westman, Claire>make sure that that's what you focus on.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10051-0
01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:15.380
<v Westman, Claire>Anyone have an idea how?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10061-0
01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:17.300
<v Westman, Claire>Especially the bibliography and our study
guide.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10082-0
01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:21.922
<v Westman, Claire>The bibliography is there as a
bibliography for the information that's</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10082-1
01:16:21.922 --> 01:16:25.111
<v Westman, Claire>included in the study guide and also for
you to.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10082-2
01:16:25.111 --> 01:16:28.300
<v Westman, Claire>You can go look use those references to
look up.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10107-0
01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:37.786
<v Westman, Claire>But you don't need to reference the
bibliography from the study guide in your</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10107-1
01:16:37.786 --> 01:16:41.170
<v Westman, Claire>work,
unless you've used one of those sources.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10128-0
01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:44.230
<v Westman, Claire>So if you're using the study guide as
your source,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10128-1
01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:48.610
<v Westman, Claire>you reference the study guide. OK,
so I hope that answers your question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10155-0
01:16:48.690 --> 01:16:53.196
<v Westman, Claire>The only time you would need to worry
about the references in the bibliography</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10155-1
01:16:53.196 --> 01:16:57.530
<v Westman, Claire>is if you used any of those sources that
you had found in the bibliography.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10174-0
01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.875
<v Westman, Claire>I won't get into technical referencing
now,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10174-1
01:17:02.875 --> 01:17:06.320
<v Westman, Claire>so just focus on if you've used the study
guide, reference the study guide.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10176-0
01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.240
<v Westman, Claire>That's all we want to see.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10185-0
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:15.170
<v Westman, Claire>Oh yeah, that's another very good point,
guys.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10189-0
01:17:15.170 --> 01:17:18.610
<v Westman, Claire>I'm ladies and gentlemen and everybody.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10219-0
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:25.527
<v Westman, Claire>I'm so excited to see how the excellent
thoughts that are coming up in this</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10219-1
01:17:25.527 --> 01:17:31.065
<v Westman, Claire>discussion or in the chat section and the
thoughts that you've been putting into</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10219-2
01:17:31.065 --> 01:17:34.210
<v Westman, Claire>these topics, very,
very exciting for me and.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10225-0
01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:37.290
<v Westman, Claire>Yeah, wonderful to see.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10236-0
01:17:37.290 --> 01:17:41.049
<v Westman, Claire>So thank you for you know the thoughts
that you've contributed and the ideas</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10236-1
01:17:41.049 --> 01:17:42.610
<v Westman, Claire>that you are coming out of here.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10244-0
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:44.710
<v Westman, Claire>It's quite hypocrit.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10249-0
01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:47.310
<v Westman, Claire>This is the chat. It says favourites.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10278-0
01:17:47.310 --> 01:17:50.802
<v Westman, Claire>It's quite hypocritical because the
reason why we now rely on Western</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10278-1
01:17:50.802 --> 01:17:54.942
<v Westman, Claire>philosophy is because Westerners thought
Africans were incapable of reasoning in a</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10278-2
01:17:54.942 --> 01:17:55.590
<v Westman, Claire>critical way.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10290-0
01:17:55.630 --> 01:17:58.070
<v Westman, Claire>Meanwhile,
their ancestors believed in myths and</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10290-1
01:17:58.070 --> 01:18:00.110
<v Westman, Claire>Folklore's, just like early Africans did.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10293-0
01:18:00.230 --> 01:18:02.390
<v Westman, Claire>Absolutely, 100%.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10310-0
01:18:05.210 --> 01:18:11.150
<v Westman, Claire>So it is hypocritical and I mean just
continue to believe in myth and</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10310-1
01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:13.610
<v Westman, Claire>superstition and all of that.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10314-0
01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.920
<v Westman, Claire>Just a very, very, very good point.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10328-0
01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.640
<v Westman, Claire>But I'm very impressed by the ideas that
I'm seeing come out in this chat.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10335-0
01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.640
<v Westman, Claire>So simple, Kazi says.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10345-0
01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:30.680
<v Westman, Claire>Did they contribute to the early
discovery of science,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10345-1
01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:31.840
<v Westman, Claire>Thais and the others?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10351-0
01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.160
<v Westman, Claire>So yes, so meta physicians did contribute.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10375-0
01:18:37.090 --> 01:18:41.597
<v Westman, Claire>And sorry, Tabili replied and said yes.
Meta physicians were pioneers of the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10375-1
01:18:41.597 --> 01:18:42.650
<v Westman, Claire>scientific method.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10389-0
01:18:42.650 --> 01:18:46.375
<v Westman, Claire>They sought to understand the fundamental
nature of reality through reason,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10389-1
01:18:46.375 --> 01:18:48.090
<v Westman, Claire>observation and systematic inquiry.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10392-0
01:18:48.130 --> 01:18:50.330
<v Westman, Claire>Excellent, great response.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10409-0
01:18:56.620 --> 01:19:02.193
<v Westman, Claire>Yes. So the the purpose of the discussion,
these are to help you to approach this</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10409-1
01:19:02.193 --> 01:19:02.940
<v Westman, Claire>assignment.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10433-0
01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:06.323
<v Westman, Claire>Specifically,
this is some of the content you should</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10433-1
01:19:06.323 --> 01:19:10.024
<v Westman, Claire>sort of be considering when you're doing
your assignment,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10433-2
01:19:10.024 --> 01:19:13.980
<v Westman, Claire>but obviously there to help you
understand the units as well.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10452-0
01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:18.931
<v Westman, Claire>But more specifically for today,
like I mentioned at the outset,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10452-1
01:19:18.931 --> 01:19:22.090
<v Westman, Claire>the focus is on helping you with the
assignment questions.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10454-0
01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:24.010
<v Westman, Claire>Um.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10462-0
01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:35.070
<v Westman, Claire>Tabela that is an excellent question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10495-0
01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:39.222
<v Westman, Claire>What role did ancient knowledge systems
and esoteric traditions,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10495-1
01:19:39.222 --> 01:19:43.521
<v Westman, Claire>including secret societies,
play in shaping the emergence of profound</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10495-2
01:19:43.521 --> 01:19:45.670
<v Westman, Claire>metaphysical philosophical inquiry?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10525-0
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:48.367
<v Westman, Claire>In particular,
how did figures such as Pythagoras who</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10525-1
01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:51.953
<v Westman, Claire>made significant contributions to
philosophy and science while also being</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10525-2
01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:54.812
<v Westman, Claire>deeply engaged in mysticism,
influenced the development of</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10525-3
01:19:54.812 --> 01:19:56.750
<v Westman, Claire>intellectual thought during this period?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10529-0
01:19:57.450 --> 01:19:58.650
<v Westman, Claire>That's an excellent question.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10569-0
01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:03.312
<v Westman, Claire>And I think one that we won't get into
today because of time,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10569-1
01:20:03.312 --> 01:20:07.572
<v Westman, Claire>but next week we'll focus on question
three of the assessment.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10569-2
01:20:07.572 --> 01:20:11.966
<v Westman, Claire>But in the following weeks,
we'll look at Unit 1 in more detail.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10569-3
01:20:11.966 --> 01:20:16.090
<v Westman, Claire>And I think that is something we can go
into in more detail.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10574-0
01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:16.960
<v Westman, Claire>Then OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10598-0
01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:21.546
<v Westman, Claire>I don't want to go too far off the topic
just because the focus is for the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10598-1
01:20:21.546 --> 01:20:24.532
<v Westman, Claire>assessment,
but that is a fantastic question that we</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10598-2
01:20:24.532 --> 01:20:26.560
<v Westman, Claire>will look at more deeply in another.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10600-0
01:20:27.610 --> 01:20:28.130
<v Westman, Claire>Session.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10602-0
01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:30.140
<v Westman, Claire>So thank you for that.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10637-0
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.011
<v Westman, Claire>I will make a note of it so that we can
discuss it in another session and it'll</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10637-1
01:20:35.011 --> 01:20:37.367
<v Westman, Claire>be interesting to hear what you think as
well.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10637-2
01:20:37.367 --> 01:20:41.377
<v Westman, Claire>So everybody can sort of think about that
question when they are finished their</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10637-3
01:20:41.377 --> 01:20:42.880
<v Westman, Claire>assignments and less stressed.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10661-0
01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:52.759
<v Westman, Claire>If I use a reference website for my
bibliography be highlighted.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10661-1
01:20:52.759 --> 01:20:57.140
<v Westman, Claire>Since I use the website now,
that's fine to be honest.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10706-0
01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:02.000
<v Westman, Claire>The bibliography is not always
necessarily included.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10706-1
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.185
<v Westman, Claire>When we check plagiarism,
because so often the references come up</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10706-2
01:21:06.185 --> 01:21:09.798
<v Westman, Claire>as plagiarized,
no matter whether you talk them into the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10706-3
01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:14.109
<v Westman, Claire>document yourself or not,
and the bibliography because they've been</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10706-4
01:21:14.109 --> 01:21:15.440
<v Westman, Claire>referenced elsewhere.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10710-0
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.190
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10719-0
01:21:16.190 --> 01:21:19.870
<v Westman, Claire>So if you want to use a referencing tool
that is absolutely fine.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10728-0
01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.240
<v Westman, Claire>Just make sure that you're referencing.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10735-0
01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:26.520
<v Westman, Claire>Is it's all consistent.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10752-0
01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:30.004
<v Westman, Claire>Your if you,
if you know how to use the referencing</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10752-1
01:21:30.004 --> 01:21:32.320
<v Westman, Claire>tools,
you are absolutely welcome to use them.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10772-0
01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:37.111
<v Westman, Claire>Just remember we use Harvard, but yeah,
you're absolutely welcome to use a</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10772-1
01:21:37.111 --> 01:21:40.240
<v Westman, Claire>referencing tool if that is what you want
to do.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10774-0
01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.800
<v Westman, Claire>No issue with that at all.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10777-0
01:21:42.650 --> 01:21:43.730
<v Westman, Claire>OK, there was.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10785-0
01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.960
<v Westman, Claire>I see two hands, but I think 1 is.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10805-0
01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.100
<v Westman, Claire>A legacy. Luanda is yours,
just up from earlier.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10805-1
01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:53.680
<v Westman, Claire>Or do you have another question?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10811-0
01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.280
<v Westman, Claire>OK, another hand has suddenly gone down.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10817-0
01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:58.440
<v Westman, Claire>So I assume that was an accidental hand.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10820-0
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.430
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10843-0
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:10.334
<v Westman, Claire>So here are do you have any questions? OK.
I don't want to take much more of your</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10843-1
01:22:10.334 --> 01:22:13.350
<v Westman, Claire>time and I do have another class, Nana.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10845-0
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:15.750
<v Westman, Claire>So are there anything?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10851-0
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:20.630
<v Westman, Claire>Are there any questions that are
absolutely pressing right now?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10882-0
01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:28.278
<v Westman, Claire>Just while you're thinking about it,
one thing I want to mention is we've been</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10882-1
01:22:28.278 --> 01:22:33.726
<v Westman, Claire>getting some emails asking how many
points of information need to be included</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10882-2
01:22:33.726 --> 01:22:35.960
<v Westman, Claire>in your answer for the 15 marks.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10885-0
01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.840
<v Westman, Claire>Remember, we're not looking for.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10895-0
01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:42.560
<v Westman, Claire>You don't have to list 15 points in order
to get 15 marks.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10903-0
01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:46.920
<v Westman, Claire>What we're looking for is,
have you explained the theory?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10908-0
01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:50.280
<v Westman, Claire>Accurately and clearly.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10928-0
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:57.007
<v Westman, Claire>Let's say for question one,
have you developed a claim that you've</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10928-1
01:22:57.007 --> 01:22:59.670
<v Westman, Claire>been developed an argument to support?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10933-0
01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:01.430
<v Westman, Claire>So have you said yes? No.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10954-0
01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:06.519
<v Westman, Claire>Balanced view,
whatever and have you supported that</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10954-1
01:23:06.519 --> 01:23:10.440
<v Westman, Claire>argument and have you included your in
text referencing in a bibliography?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10957-0
01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:12.480
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10978-0
01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:17.597
<v Westman, Claire>So it's very difficult in a subject like
this to say you need to include this many</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10978-1
01:23:17.597 --> 01:23:21.480
<v Westman, Claire>points because everybody will answer the
question differently.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10992-0
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:24.536
<v Westman, Claire>Differently,
So what we want to see is do have you</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/10992-1
01:23:24.536 --> 01:23:27.430
<v Westman, Claire>shown an understanding of the content of
the theory?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11004-0
01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:31.200
<v Westman, Claire>And then have you developed a clear
answer?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11025-0
01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:36.980
<v Westman, Claire>So for example, with the second question,
have you made the link between the</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11025-1
01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:41.440
<v Westman, Claire>definitions or understandings of
metaphysics and the lesions?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11031-0
01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:42.960
<v Westman, Claire>Has that come across clearly?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11035-0
01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.840
<v Westman, Claire>So have you explained what metaphysics is?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11042-0
01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.360
<v Westman, Claire>Have you explained what the malesions
were?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11049-0
01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:50.200
<v Westman, Claire>What kind of philosophical inquiry?
They were engaged in?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11057-0
01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:52.830
<v Westman, Claire>And have you then made that link between
them?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11075-0
01:23:55.360 --> 01:24:03.320
<v Westman, Claire>And then for the last question is about
Plato's theory of forms and virtue.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11080-0
01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.960
<v Westman, Claire>So again, we'll want to see.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11084-0
01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:07.800
<v Westman, Claire>Have you explained the theory clearly?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11091-0
01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.880
<v Westman, Claire>Have you developed a claim?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11095-0
01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.960
<v Westman, Claire>Have you included your referencing?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11096-0
01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.240
<v Westman, Claire>Is it clear?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11101-0
01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:14.680
<v Westman, Claire>Have you shown an understanding?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11104-0
01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.080
<v Westman, Claire>So that's what we'll be looking for.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11119-0
01:24:16.670 --> 01:24:19.402
<v Westman, Claire>OK.
And we know at the stage that you know</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11119-1
01:24:19.402 --> 01:24:22.070
<v Westman, Claire>you're you're new to referencing probably.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11129-0
01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.200
<v Westman, Claire>So do your best with the referencing.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11150-0
01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:27.934
<v Westman, Claire>We will be lenient if it's not exactly
right.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11150-1
01:24:27.934 --> 01:24:31.142
<v Westman, Claire>If we see you've made an effort with the
referencing,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11150-2
01:24:31.142 --> 01:24:33.400
<v Westman, Claire>that's what we're concerned about, OK?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11162-0
01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:39.280
<v Westman, Claire>Leander is it a hand for now or is it a
hand from earlier?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11165-0
01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:42.410
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>Zahan from now.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11167-0
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:43.550
<v Westman, Claire>Oh yes.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11200-0
01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:47.216
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>So your question might be a little
pessimistic,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11200-1
01:24:47.216 --> 01:24:50.920
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>but given that we've taken philosophy now
in the first semester,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11200-2
01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:55.365
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>can we then discontinue from second
semester or is this a module that we have</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11200-3
01:24:55.365 --> 01:24:56.960
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>to take throughout the year?</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11205-0
01:24:57.610 --> 01:24:59.330
<v Westman, Claire>This is only SMS to module.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11208-0
01:25:00.090 --> 01:25:00.490
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>OK.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11209-0
01:25:00.490 --> 01:25:01.010
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>Thank you.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11211-0
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:02.870
<v Westman, Claire>I know.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11215-0
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:06.190
<v Westman, Claire>I'm already losing people.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11220-0
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:09.750
<v Westman, Claire>Yeah, this is a simista module.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11223-0
01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.760
<v Westman, Claire>Give it a chance.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11233-0
01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:19.720
<v Westman, Claire>I've had somebody else as the e-mail
about how to change modules.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11246-0
01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.960
<v Westman, Claire>But I know philosophy can be tricky.
When you first start. I really do.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11252-0
01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:27.560
<v Westman, Claire>But give it a go.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11255-0
01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:27.880
<v Westman, Claire>Give it a chance.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11260-0
01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:29.640
<v Westman, Claire>Let's see how the semester goes.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11270-0

<v Westman, Claire>And remember this very there's different
kinds of philosophies.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11270-1
01:25:33.544 --> 01:25:36.400

01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:41.213
<v Westman, Claire>In first year,

01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:51.150
<v Westman, Claire>So these are some sources that are quite
useful.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11324-0
01:25:51.150 --> 01:25:56.350
<v Westman, Claire>And the Stanford Encyclopedia philosophy
is always useful, but it can be.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11331-0

did. The studies they did,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11383-1

<v Westman, Claire>very nice videos that help to breakdown
complex philosophical concepts.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11417-0

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11491-1
01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:15.857
<v Westman, Claire>use websites that make things less
complex because philosophy is complex,</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11491-2
01:27:15.857 --> 01:27:17.390
<v Westman, Claire>it is challenging.</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11518-0
01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:23.152
<v Westman, Claire>And a lot of ideas that you've probably
never sort of encountered before in ways</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11518-1
01:27:23.152 --> 01:27:27.160

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:31.029
<v Westman, Claire>So don't be hard on yourself either.
If you're not understanding it straight</v>

d95dcb18-375c-49af-bc45-41cc55f0b00a/11527-1

experiences most people are going to be</v>
