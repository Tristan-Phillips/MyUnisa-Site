00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:05.249
<v Westman, Claire>Yes, I see.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/106-0
00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:13.209
<v Westman, Claire>Somebody asked if they can use AI to
spell check, but to check your grammar.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/118-0
00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.519
<v Westman, Claire>But you shouldn't really need to use AI
to check your grammar.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/138-0
00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:23.315
<v Westman, Claire>You can use Grammarly so I'm not sure if
you have any of you have heard of</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/138-1
00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:25.479
<v Westman, Claire>Grammarly. I'm sure you have.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/141-0
00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:26.639
<v Westman, Claire>I've put it there in the chat.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/151-0
00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.009
<v Westman, Claire>That is a very useful tool to help you,
you can.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/159-0
00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:35.769
<v Westman, Claire>Load it onto your computer.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/175-0
00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.916
<v Westman, Claire>Or can even be part of your browser and
it can help you to check your spelling</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/175-1
00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:42.809
<v Westman, Claire>and your grammar.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/192-0
00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:48.799
<v Westman, Claire>Again, just to be very careful of AI,
I'm not going to go over that again.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/194-0
00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:50.239
<v Westman, Claire>We discussed it last time.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/216-0
00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:57.047
<v Westman, Claire>So if you are not sure about that,
just go back and listen to the lesson</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/216-1
00:00:57.047 --> 00:00:58.009
<v Westman, Claire>from last week.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/246-0
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:02.523
<v Westman, Claire>I don't want to go over things that we've
gone over before because I know that you</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/246-1
00:01:02.523 --> 00:01:06.384
<v Westman, Claire>need to actually be working on the
assignments so you don't want to be</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/246-2
00:01:06.384 --> 00:01:09.049
<v Westman, Claire>sitting here hearing things you've heard
before.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/253-0
00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:12.464
<v Westman, Claire>Again,
I'm just going to say please read the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/253-1
00:01:12.464 --> 00:01:13.489
<v Westman, Claire>announcements.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/263-0
00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.759
<v Westman, Claire>Please read the instructions.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/291-0
00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.911
<v Westman, Claire>I'm still getting questions about
introductions, conclusions, cover pages,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/291-1
00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:26.013
<v Westman, Claire>contents pages,
how to reference the study guide.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/291-2
00:01:26.013 --> 00:01:30.279
<v Westman, Claire>I've put all this information in the
announcements.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/312-0
00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:34.754
<v Westman, Claire>It's in the instructions,
so all of these questions that I'm</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/312-1
00:01:34.754 --> 00:01:40.771
<v Westman, Claire>getting over and over and over and over
the information is there for you and it's</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/312-2
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:42.679
<v Westman, Claire>making me a bit concerned.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/356-0
00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.553
<v Westman, Claire>That you're not actually reading through
the information that is provided for you,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/356-1
00:01:48.553 --> 00:01:52.114
<v Westman, Claire>so please make sure you're doing that so
before you are,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/356-2
00:01:52.114 --> 00:01:56.111
<v Westman, Claire>I'm very happy to answer questions like
I've said before, very,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/356-3
00:01:56.111 --> 00:02:00.609
<v Westman, Claire>very happy to help you where you need
help. But before you ask a quest.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/364-0
00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.329
<v Westman, Claire>Go look through the materials on the site.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/381-0
00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:10.122
<v Westman, Claire>Look at the instructions of the
assignment and make sure that those</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/381-1
00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:12.169
<v Westman, Claire>questions aren't already answered for you.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/425-0
00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:17.815
<v Westman, Claire>Because it takes a lot of time for me to
reply to 100 people asking if you need a</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/425-1
00:02:17.815 --> 00:02:22.238
<v Westman, Claire>contents page when there is an
announcement about a contents page or</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/425-2
00:02:22.238 --> 00:02:27.431
<v Westman, Claire>asking if there should be an introduction
and conclusion when it is very clearly</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/425-3
00:02:27.431 --> 00:02:28.649
<v Westman, Claire>stated in the inst.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/431-0
00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:29.519
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/435-0
00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:33.919
<v Westman, Claire>So again,
don't be afraid to ask me anything.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/450-0
00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.209
<v Westman, Claire>But always just try and see if that
information is already out there.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/452-0
00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:45.569
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/468-0
00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.049
<v Westman, Claire>So I see again some mixed reactions about
the assignment.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/473-0
00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:54.049
<v Westman, Claire>Some people said it's going OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/488-0
00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.609
<v Westman, Claire>Some people saying it seems to think it
seems to be fine here.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/489-0
00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:57.289
<v Nthabiseng Vinoliah  Rammole>But I.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/499-0
00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.529
<v Westman, Claire>A bit stressful,
especially the word count.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/502-0
00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:04.769
<v Westman, Claire>I know 300 words is not a lot.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/514-0
00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.609
<v Westman, Claire>But just try to stick to it as much as
possible.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/520-0
00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:14.449
<v Westman, Claire>I know it says say that if you're over
the word count.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/527-0
00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:15.879
<v Westman, Claire>It might not be marked.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/541-0
00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.815
<v Westman, Claire>We definitely will mark it. Don't worry,
you're not going to get zero for going</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/541-1
00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:20.799
<v Westman, Claire>over the word count.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/552-0
00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.449
<v Westman, Claire>But we might reduce some of the marks.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/590-0
00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.605
<v Westman, Claire>If you have gone way over the word count,
OK, and you know,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/562-0
00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.439
<v Ntsako Nkuna>Hey.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/590-1
00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:35.461
<v Westman, Claire>sometimes we see things like it'll say,
for example,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/570-0
00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.489
<v Ntsako Nkuna>Aye.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/590-2
00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:40.919
<v Westman, Claire>if for your next assignment where it's
1000 word, essay or whatever it is.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/587-0
00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.699
<v Nthabiseng Vinoliah  Rammole>Play.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/589-0
00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:41.859
<v Ntsako Nkuna>Yes.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/598-0
00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.289
<v Westman, Claire>Some people will submit 10 pages.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/606-0
00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:47.769
<v Westman, Claire>And very often it's because they've
submitted.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/620-0
00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:52.929
<v Westman, Claire>An entirely plagiarized article or
something like that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/625-0
00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:56.089
<v Westman, Claire>But if you go way over the word count.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/648-0
00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.583
<v Westman, Claire>I know it's difficult when you're excited
about it, but you're enjoying it,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/648-1
00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:06.239
<v Westman, Claire>thinking about the topic,
or you have a lot of ideas.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/651-0
00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.579
<v Nthabiseng Vinoliah  Rammole>Bye bye.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/671-0
00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:13.217
<v Westman, Claire>It can be difficult to stick to the word
count and let me tell you I am a person</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/671-1
00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:14.369
<v Westman, Claire>who writes a lot.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/674-0
00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:16.409
<v Westman, Claire>I'm a very wordy person.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/690-0
00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:21.728
<v Westman, Claire>You might have even noticed when I'm
talking I, especially in my writing,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/690-1
00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:23.889
<v Westman, Claire>that I'm I used a lot of words.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/692-0
00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:26.049
<v Westman, Claire>So.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/710-0
00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:31.839
<v Westman, Claire>I understand how difficult it is to have
to condense your writing.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/721-0
00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.679
<v Westman, Claire>It's something that I still have to work
on even after being in academics for.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/715-0
00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:33.139
<v Nthabiseng Vinoliah  Rammole>Setting.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/725-0
00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:39.089
<v Westman, Claire>Many, many, many years.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/746-0
00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:46.172
<v Westman, Claire>So it will take time for you to get used
to that as well.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/746-1
00:04:46.172 --> 00:04:48.559
<v Westman, Claire>I see somebody said 303 words.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/754-0
00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:51.529
<v Westman, Claire>Oh, I wonder why it's echoing.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/760-0
00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:59.219
<v Westman, Claire>Yeah. Does anyone have their marks on?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/763-0
00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.689
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/768-0
00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:04.729
<v Westman, Claire>I've muted everybody.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/770-0
00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.089
<v Westman, Claire>Can you hear me now?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/775-0
00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:12.339
<v Westman, Claire>OK. Am I OK now?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/779-0
00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.449
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/787-0
00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:17.329
<v Westman, Claire>So somebody must have had the mark on.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/797-0
00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:19.662
<v Westman, Claire>So yeah,
just please make sure that you turn your</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/797-1
00:05:19.662 --> 00:05:20.129
<v Westman, Claire>marks off.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/801-0
00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:21.769
<v Westman, Claire>I've muted everybody for now.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/820-0
00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.455
<v Westman, Claire>It's just difficult for me to keep an eye
on the chat,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/820-1
00:05:26.455 --> 00:05:28.369
<v Westman, Claire>on the microphones and all of that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/822-0
00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:31.369
<v Westman, Claire>So everybody,
please just be careful of that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/825-0
00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:33.329
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/831-0
00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:35.049
<v Westman, Claire>So yeah, I was saying I rights a lot.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/843-0
00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:39.049
<v Westman, Claire>So it's I know how difficult it is to try
and condense your writing.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/852-0
00:05:40.609 --> 00:05:42.809
<v Westman, Claire>And then I see somebody said 303 words.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/860-0
00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.799
<v Westman, Claire>Steps absolutely perfect.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/875-0
00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:52.439
<v Westman, Claire>I promise you were not gonna be counting
an extra 3 words and penalizing you for</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/875-1
00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.559
<v Westman, Claire>that. 367 is also still OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/878-0
00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.849
<v Westman, Claire>You know again.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/900-0
00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:06.138
<v Westman, Claire>300 words is so usually when you get a
word count you need to be within the area</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/900-1
00:06:06.138 --> 00:06:07.689
<v Westman, Claire>of that word count.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/914-0
00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.939
<v Westman, Claire>So you can't submit something that's 200
words and you can't submit something.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/914-1
00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:13.849
<v Westman, Claire>That's 400 words, because that's much.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/936-0
00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:24.679
<v Westman, Claire>Too little and too much if it's around
sort of three 5360 ISH 367 is fine.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/940-0
00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.399
<v Westman, Claire>You know you're OK again.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/969-0
00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:34.639
<v Westman, Claire>Also, if you're like 200 and 72180 words,
you're OK if the word count is 300,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/969-1
00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:40.079
<v Westman, Claire>so we don't expect you to sit there and
work out exactly 300 words.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/971-0
00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:41.409
<v Westman, Claire>That is.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/974-0
00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:44.129
<v Westman, Claire>That is the range you need.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/978-0
00:06:44.359 --> 00:06:45.639
<v Westman, Claire>Need to be in OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/985-0
00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:50.289
<v Westman, Claire>656 years.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/987-0
00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:51.929
<v Westman, Claire>That's way over.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1004-0
00:06:54.729 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Westman, Claire>Lassander,
the university policy is 21 working days</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1004-1
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.049
<v Westman, Claire>for your marks.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1026-0
00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:08.804
<v Westman, Claire>So that is what we aim to work on.
Remember for this module there are four</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1026-1
00:07:08.804 --> 00:07:13.409
<v Westman, Claire>of us who do marking.
So some marking might be done.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1068-0
00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:17.530
<v Westman, Claire>A bit quicker,
so I might you know some some of us might</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1068-1
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.479
<v Westman, Claire>get on a bit more quickly than other
people depending on what our marking load</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1068-2
00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:27.554
<v Westman, Claire>is at the time because you are not out,
you know this is not our only module for</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1068-3
00:07:27.554 --> 00:07:28.369
<v Westman, Claire>all of us we.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1092-0
00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:31.990
<v Westman, Claire>All have other modules as well,
so we work.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1092-1
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:37.999
<v Westman, Claire>We try our work on 21 working days to get
your marks back to you. So if.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1100-0
00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:41.049
<v Westman, Claire>You don't get your marks after three
weeks.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1105-0
00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:44.009
<v Westman, Claire>Then let us know.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1113-0
00:07:44.239 --> 00:07:47.199
<v Westman, Claire>That you haven't received them.
If it's within three weeks.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1116-0
00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:50.299
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1133-0
00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:53.654
<v Westman, Claire>I just said that some of,
but I think you might have been typing</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1133-1
00:07:53.654 --> 00:07:54.699
<v Westman, Claire>that while I was talking.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1140-0
00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:57.219
<v Westman, Claire>Some might get your marks a bit earlier
than others.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1178-0
00:07:57.219 --> 00:08:01.050
<v Westman, Claire>So what I'm saying is,
if you haven't got your marks after three</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1178-1
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.821
<v Westman, Claire>weeks,
then let me know if your friend has got</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1178-2
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:07.181
<v Westman, Claire>their Marks and you haven't got yours,
then don't panic.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1178-3
00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:11.189
<v Westman, Claire>If it's within that time frame,
you might have just had a different</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1178-4
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.779
<v Westman, Claire>marker or.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1191-0
00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:15.730
<v Westman, Claire>Mark,
Mark this week and then mark some next</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1191-1
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.329
<v Westman, Claire>week, whatever it is, OK, so.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1195-0
00:08:18.929 --> 00:08:19.569
<v Westman, Claire>Please don't panic.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1212-0
00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:26.759
<v Westman, Claire>And we will only start marking from next
week. Even though you submit tomorrow.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1228-0
00:08:27.119 --> 00:08:32.496
<v Westman, Claire>But then there's a process where I have
to allocate marking to markers so that</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1228-1
00:08:32.496 --> 00:08:34.879
<v Westman, Claire>takes a little bit of time as well.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1257-0
00:08:36.489 --> 00:08:39.477
<v Westman, Claire>OK,
so I think let's get into the important</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1257-1
00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:43.959
<v Westman, Claire>stuff for today. Obviously,
if you have questions as we go along,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1257-2
00:08:43.959 --> 00:08:45.929
<v Westman, Claire>please post them in the chat.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1265-0
00:08:46.769 --> 00:08:49.729
<v Westman, Claire>I see some of you are assisting me.
Thank you very much.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1294-0
00:08:49.999 --> 00:08:54.779
<v Westman, Claire>About answering your your peers in the
module and also thank you on the WhatsApp</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1294-1
00:08:54.779 --> 00:08:59.559
<v Westman, Claire>group, there was a lot of chat last night,
so I've not gone through all of that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1314-0
00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:05.777
<v Westman, Claire>But thank you to all of you who are
engaging on the WhatsApp group and</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1314-1
00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:06.799
<v Westman, Claire>helping each other.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1329-0
00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:11.479
<v Westman, Claire>It's very encouraging to see you helping
the other people in the module and</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1329-1
00:09:11.479 --> 00:09:14.559
<v Westman, Claire>working together and building a little
community.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1336-0
00:09:15.969 --> 00:09:17.569
<v Westman, Claire>Of you know,
with your peers in the module.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1339-0
00:09:19.329 --> 00:09:19.489
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1360-0
00:09:19.849 --> 00:09:24.907
<v Westman, Claire>So today we are only looking at question
three of the assignment question one and</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1360-1
00:09:24.907 --> 00:09:26.449
<v Westman, Claire>two we covered last week.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1369-0
00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:29.769
<v Westman, Claire>So if you haven't watched last week's
session, please go do so.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1405-0
00:09:30.439 --> 00:09:33.421
<v Westman, Claire>I saw,
I think on the WhatsApp that somebody</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1405-1
00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:37.199
<v Westman, Claire>said they weren't quite sure how to
answer question one,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1405-2
00:09:37.199 --> 00:09:42.368
<v Westman, Claire>and I'm perhaps that's because they
didn't watch last week's recording yet or</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1405-3
00:09:42.368 --> 00:09:43.959
<v Westman, Claire>didn't attend last week.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1416-0
00:09:44.079 --> 00:09:47.585
<v Westman, Claire>So if you are,
if you haven't watched last week's</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1416-1
00:09:47.585 --> 00:09:49.479
<v Westman, Claire>recording, please go do so.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1431-0
00:09:51.009 --> 00:09:54.969
<v Westman, Claire>And then today we're just going to look
at question 3OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1439-0
00:09:55.409 --> 00:09:59.884
<v Westman, Claire>So we're going to look at question three
and then you can ask any of your</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1439-1
00:09:59.884 --> 00:10:00.489
<v Westman, Claire>questions.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1443-0
00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:03.679
<v Westman, Claire>So Question 3 asks.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1454-0
00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:09.059
<v Westman, Claire>Why did Plato think that virtue depends
on knowledge?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1467-0
00:10:09.179 --> 00:10:12.899
<v Westman, Claire>Do you agree with this view and explain
your answer?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1487-0
00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:17.883
<v Westman, Claire>So remember, like I said last week,
whenever you have a question,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1487-1
00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:23.139
<v Westman, Claire>the first thing you want to do is look at
what the question is asking you.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1490-0
00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:25.839
<v Westman, Claire>Very carefully.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1495-0
00:10:25.839 --> 00:10:26.479
<v Westman, Claire>So you want to break it down?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1501-0
00:10:26.479 --> 00:10:29.239
<v Westman, Claire>So here we know we're talking about Plato.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1505-0
00:10:29.239 --> 00:10:33.519
<v Westman, Claire>We're talking about virtue and knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1515-0
00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:40.439
<v Westman, Claire>And then it goes beyond asking you to
simply explain.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1548-0
00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:47.217
<v Westman, Claire>Plato's ideas around knowledge and virtue,
and asks you if you agree or disagree</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1548-1
00:10:47.217 --> 00:10:51.631
<v Westman, Claire>with what platea thanks.
And in doing so you need to explain your</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1548-2
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:53.839
<v Westman, Claire>answer so you can't just say yes.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1551-0
00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:54.479
<v Westman, Claire>I agree.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1554-0
00:10:54.479 --> 00:10:55.719
<v Westman, Claire>Or no, I don't agree.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1560-0
00:10:55.719 --> 00:10:59.279
<v Westman, Claire>And leave it at that.
You need to explain your answer.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1562-0
00:11:00.999 --> 00:11:01.319
<v Westman, Claire>More fully.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1574-0
00:11:02.409 --> 00:11:04.249
<v Westman, Claire>And so I'm just closing something quickly.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1615-0
00:11:04.489 --> 00:11:07.439
<v Westman, Claire>OK,
so always again we spoke about this last</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1615-1
00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:09.865
<v Westman, Claire>week,
but always when you start your</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1615-2
00:11:09.865 --> 00:11:14.258
<v Westman, Claire>assignments or even when you get your
exams or anything like that,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1615-3
00:11:14.258 --> 00:11:19.437
<v Westman, Claire>the first thing you must always do before
you start answering is breakdown the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1615-4
00:11:19.437 --> 00:11:22.519
<v Westman, Claire>question and try and think about exactly
what.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1626-0
00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:25.449
<v Westman, Claire>It is asking you and how it's asking you
to do that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1636-0
00:11:25.569 --> 00:11:30.649
<v Westman, Claire>So instruction words would for example be
that it tells you 300 words.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1639-0
00:11:31.359 --> 00:11:31.679
<v Westman, Claire>Is your word count.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1645-0
00:11:33.909 --> 00:11:36.829
<v Westman, Claire>So always look at that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1648-0
00:11:36.869 --> 00:11:38.669
<v Westman, Claire>Sorry, I see somebody said.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1654-0
00:11:41.479 --> 00:11:43.439
<v Westman, Claire>How did it stop recording? Thank you.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1657-0
00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:45.959
<v Westman, Claire>It says it's recording.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1668-0
00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:56.889
<v Westman, Claire>Is it showing that it's recording on
anybody else's?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1678-0
00:11:56.889 --> 00:11:59.929
<v Westman, Claire>Because I mine is showing the little
recording thing.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1684-0
00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:04.689
<v Westman, Claire>OK, alright. Yeah. On my side,
it looks like it's recording.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1693-0
00:12:06.679 --> 00:12:09.926
<v Westman, Claire>Ish. Ramu lephie.
Do you have a question you can turn on</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1693-1
00:12:09.926 --> 00:12:10.439
<v Westman, Claire>your mic?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1702-0
00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:22.069
<v Westman, Claire>Esra Molefi a question.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1705-0
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:23.269
<v Westman, Claire>Your hand is up, OK?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1708-0
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:25.029
<v Westman, Claire>All right. OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1721-0
00:12:25.149 --> 00:12:28.700
<v Westman, Claire>Thank you for letting me know.
In any case, yeah. Obviously,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1721-1
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.669
<v Westman, Claire>if you do notice anything weird,
just let me know.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1723-0
00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:33.439
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1744-0
00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:41.648
<v Westman, Claire>So to answer this question again,
it's tricky because it's 300 words and</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1744-1
00:12:41.648 --> 00:12:44.559
<v Westman, Claire>you could write a lot about Plato.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1753-0
00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:48.679
<v Westman, Claire>So you're going to need to focus on the
most important information.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1763-0
00:12:49.029 --> 00:12:54.069
<v Westman, Claire>And for that reason,
we won't go into a lot of detail.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1789-0
00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:59.871
<v Westman, Claire>About Plato's theory of the forms,
we need to touch on it,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1789-1
00:12:59.871 --> 00:13:04.799
<v Westman, Claire>because you need to explain that in order
to get to your answer.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1814-0
00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:10.214
<v Westman, Claire>But for today's purposes,
we're not going to go into the very</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1814-1
00:13:10.214 --> 00:13:16.349
<v Westman, Claire>intricate information about the his idea
of the form we're going to look at it</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1814-2
00:13:16.349 --> 00:13:18.679
<v Westman, Claire>briefly because you only need.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1842-0
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:24.418
<v Westman, Claire>To you will only be able to discuss the
theory of the forms briefly in your</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1842-1
00:13:24.418 --> 00:13:28.022
<v Westman, Claire>answer. OK,
so in order to answer this question,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1842-2
00:13:28.022 --> 00:13:32.509
<v Westman, Claire>you're going to need to explain Plato's
theory of the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1867-0
00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:42.253
<v Westman, Claire>In order to show why he thinks that the
form of the good is the highest of the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1867-1
00:13:42.253 --> 00:13:48.359
<v Westman, Claire>forms, and in so doing,
that will help you to explain why.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1875-0
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:52.389
<v Westman, Claire>He thinks that virtue depends on
knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1877-0
00:13:52.589 --> 00:13:52.749
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1890-0
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:58.270
<v Westman, Claire>So we've got kind of got three things
that you need to do before you Give your</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1890-1
00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:58.829
<v Westman, Claire>opinion.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1901-0
00:13:59.189 --> 00:14:03.309
<v Westman, Claire>You need to give a brief idea of what the
theory of the forms is.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1905-0
00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:06.479
<v Westman, Claire>Show what?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1923-0
00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:09.486
<v Westman, Claire>Show why,
he says the form of the good is or</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1923-1
00:14:09.486 --> 00:14:14.359
<v Westman, Claire>explain that he thinks that the form of
the good is the most important form.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1932-0
00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:21.339
<v Westman, Claire>See, people are not muted again.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1936-0
00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:23.219
<v Westman, Claire>Why he thinks that?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1945-0
00:14:23.219 --> 00:14:26.499
<v Westman, Claire>The form of the good is the highest of
all forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1952-0
00:14:26.579 --> 00:14:30.739
<v Westman, Claire>And then how the pursuit of the form of
the good?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1968-0
00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:35.279
<v Westman, Claire>Is related to virtue or how? That depends.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1971-0
00:14:35.359 --> 00:14:38.199
<v Westman, Claire>Virtue depends on working towards that
knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1973-0
00:14:39.919 --> 00:14:40.079
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1977-0
00:14:43.159 --> 00:14:43.479
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1980-0
00:14:43.479 --> 00:14:44.879
<v Westman, Claire>All right.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1985-0
00:14:45.239 --> 00:14:47.919
<v Westman, Claire>So there is a lot going on on my screen
here.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1995-0
00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:53.401
<v Westman, Claire>Please,

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/1995-1

I'm having to let people in.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2027-0
00:15:04.439 --> 00:15:06.799
<v Westman, Claire>There's a lot coming up in the chat.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2030-0
00:15:08.599 --> 00:15:08.759
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2037-0
00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:12.039
<v Westman, Claire>So if, unless it's important,
please don't post it in the chat.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2046-0
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:14.789
<v Westman, Claire>OK, so I will say this again.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2049-0
00:15:14.989 --> 00:15:18.709
<v Westman, Claire>There are three things you need to focus
on.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2068-0
00:15:21.819 --> 00:15:25.751
<v Westman, Claire>In order to give an overview of Plato's
theory,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2068-1
00:15:25.751 --> 00:15:28.619
<v Westman, Claire>you need to 1st we get to that now.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2075-0
00:15:28.619 --> 00:15:29.419
<v Westman, Claire>Don't look at that yet.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2076-0
00:15:29.419 --> 00:15:30.859
<v Westman, Claire>Otherwise you'll get distracted.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2091-0
00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:37.659
<v Westman, Claire>You need to give a brief overview of
Plato's idea of the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2097-0
00:15:40.229 --> 00:15:43.429
<v Westman, Claire>Then you will need to explain.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2115-0
00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:48.626
<v Westman, Claire>Why?
Or you will need to explain that Plato</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2115-1
00:15:48.626 --> 00:15:52.799
<v Westman, Claire>thinks the form of the good is the
highest form.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2126-0
00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:59.279
<v Westman, Claire>And then you will need to show how this
relates to virtue.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2134-0
00:16:01.199 --> 00:16:04.479
<v Westman, Claire>So you will need to show that the pursuit
of knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2138-0
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:11.189
<v Westman, Claire>Is dependent.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2146-0
00:16:12.799 --> 00:16:14.079
<v Westman, Claire>Sorry, I'm so distracted by these chats.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2150-0
00:16:14.479 --> 00:16:15.639
<v Westman, Claire>Let me just close it for now.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2153-0
00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:16.599
<v Westman, Claire>You will need to explain.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2167-0
00:16:18.319 --> 00:16:24.319
<v Westman, Claire>That virtue depends on the pursuit of
knowledge of the form of the good.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2181-0
00:16:24.319 --> 00:16:29.342
<v Westman, Claire>We're going to look at all of this, OK,
when you Give your opinion, yes,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2181-1
00:16:29.342 --> 00:16:30.719
<v Westman, Claire>you need to back up.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2186-0
00:16:30.719 --> 00:16:32.999
<v Westman, Claire>Why you have that opinion, OK?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2195-0
00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:36.159
<v Westman, Claire>So you need to say why do you agree with
this or not?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2201-0
00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:39.319
<v Westman, Claire>You can think about objections that are
raised against.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2206-0
00:16:39.709 --> 00:16:42.389
<v Westman, Claire>Plato's theory.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2219-0
00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:46.319
<v Westman, Claire>If you agree with it,
why do you agree with it?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2225-0
00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:51.799
<v Westman, Claire>Look for some kind of information to back
up your opinion.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2228-0
00:16:54.699 --> 00:16:55.059
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2242-0
00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:59.819
<v Westman, Claire>So let's begin. The world of the forms,
according to Plato.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2255-0
00:16:59.979 --> 00:17:04.127
<v Westman, Claire>So let's look at.
This is a brief overview of his theory of</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2255-1
00:17:04.127 --> 00:17:04.819
<v Westman, Claire>the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2260-0
00:17:04.979 --> 00:17:08.219
<v Westman, Claire>So according to Plato,
so Plato was a realist.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2284-0
00:17:09.149 --> 00:17:14.831
<v Westman, Claire>Plato believed that the world that we
experience through our sense perceptions</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2284-1
00:17:14.831 --> 00:17:17.709
<v Westman, Claire>or through our five senses, is not real.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2288-0
00:17:17.709 --> 00:17:19.629
<v Westman, Claire>So we don't have real knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2309-0
00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:26.604
<v Westman, Claire>Of the world around us and we will look
at that a little bit more as we go along</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2309-1
00:17:26.604 --> 00:17:27.919
<v Westman, Claire>through this lesson.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2324-0
00:17:28.399 --> 00:17:31.795
<v Westman, Claire>So he thinks that the things we
experience in this world,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2324-1
00:17:31.795 --> 00:17:34.079
<v Westman, Claire>the things we can touch, smells Saints.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2331-0
00:17:35.839 --> 00:17:37.679
<v Westman, Claire>Are not real knowledge of those things.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2354-0
00:17:37.989 --> 00:17:41.069
<v Westman, Claire>So I can be looking at my desk and say,
OK,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2354-1
00:17:41.069 --> 00:17:46.389
<v Westman, Claire>I know what a disk is by looking at it
and Plato would say that's not true.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2380-0
00:17:46.589 --> 00:17:52.320
<v Westman, Claire>I don't have real knowledge of a desk
just by being able to touch the desk,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2380-1
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.789
<v Westman, Claire>smell the desk if I wanted to in front of
me.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2396-0
00:17:55.949 --> 00:18:02.392
<v Westman, Claire>So he says that in fact our sensory
experiences or our senses can hinder the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2396-1
00:18:02.392 --> 00:18:04.149
<v Westman, Claire>pursuit of knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2401-0
00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:07.399
<v Westman, Claire>Of true real things.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2411-0
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:11.869
<v Westman, Claire>Because they distract us from using
rational judgment or reason.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2420-0
00:18:13.749 --> 00:18:17.469
<v Westman, Claire>So he thinks that to really have
knowledge of something.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2424-0
00:18:18.919 --> 00:18:20.759
<v Westman, Claire>It cannot change.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2438-0
00:18:22.439 --> 00:18:26.634
<v Westman, Claire>Or be susceptible to decay.
So he says that the world around us</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2438-1
00:18:26.634 --> 00:18:27.159
<v Westman, Claire>changes.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2442-0
00:18:27.199 --> 00:18:28.439
<v Westman, Claire>It decays.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2456-0
00:18:28.479 --> 00:18:34.719
<v Westman, Claire>So today we might see a plant and think,
OK, that is what a plant is.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2475-0
00:18:34.759 --> 00:18:38.565
<v Westman, Claire>But then tomorrow,
maybe that or in a few days time that</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2475-1
00:18:38.565 --> 00:18:42.304
<v Westman, Claire>plant is dead.
And so it's changed and it starts to rot</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2475-2
00:18:42.304 --> 00:18:42.839
<v Westman, Claire>away so.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2484-0
00:18:43.189 --> 00:18:47.389
<v Westman, Claire>He will say that we because of that
change in the world around us.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2509-0
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:52.062
<v Westman, Claire>What we perceive,
what we experience in the world through</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2509-1
00:18:52.062 --> 00:18:55.968
<v Westman, Claire>our senses and through our perceptions,
is not true.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2509-2
00:18:55.968 --> 00:19:00.389
<v Westman, Claire>Knowledge of the things around us.
It's not true knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2539-0
00:19:01.919 --> 00:19:06.641
<v Westman, Claire>So he thinks that to have knowledge of
something to have true or real knowledge</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2539-1
00:19:06.641 --> 00:19:10.479
<v Westman, Claire>of something, it needs to be unchanging,
absolute and universal.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2570-0
00:19:14.179 --> 00:19:21.299
<v Westman, Claire>So he says that what we know must be true
and all of what we know has to be true.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2570-1
00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:27.899
<v Westman, Claire>And it always has to remain true,
despite change and deceptive appearances.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2577-0
00:19:29.359 --> 00:19:33.039
<v Westman, Claire>So he associates knowledge with truth.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2583-0
00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:36.959
<v Westman, Claire>So if something is true,
then we can know it.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2597-0
00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:40.849
<v K KAWUTA>Hey I I.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2603-0
00:19:38.759 --> 00:19:43.719
<v Westman, Claire>So he says that we can't have knowledge
and it can't be true.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2604-0
00:19:42.759 --> 00:19:43.079
<v K KAWUTA>Have a pen?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2632-0
00:19:43.989 --> 00:19:50.230
<v Westman, Claire>That what we experience is the true real
knowledge because of change and because</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2616-0
00:19:48.569 --> 00:19:48.719
<v K KAWUTA>Hello.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2632-1
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:54.469
<v Westman, Claire>of deceptive appearances,
because of the subjectivity.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2641-0
00:19:55.839 --> 00:19:58.039
<v Westman, Claire>Of our experiences, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2644-0
00:19:58.039 --> 00:20:00.159
<v Westman, Claire>So if you think about if.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2671-0
00:20:02.239 --> 00:20:06.204
<v Westman, Claire>I see the color red and you see the color
red.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2671-1
00:20:06.204 --> 00:20:12.532
<v Westman, Claire>The color red that we both see is not
necessarily the same when we see it.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2671-2
00:20:12.532 --> 00:20:13.039
<v Westman, Claire>OK so.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2678-0
00:20:13.829 --> 00:20:16.869
<v Westman, Claire>So let me give you a different example.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2710-0
00:20:18.919 --> 00:20:22.974
<v Westman, Claire>If I eat a piece of chocolate and think
that it's delicious,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2689-0
00:20:21.129 --> 00:20:21.609
<v K KAWUTA>All right.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2710-1
00:20:22.974 --> 00:20:28.359
<v Westman, Claire>you might eat that piece of chocolate
from that same slab and you don't like it.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2704-0
00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:25.499
<v K KAWUTA>Yes, Sir.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2716-0
00:20:28.359 --> 00:20:31.239
<v Westman, Claire>So maybe it's dark chocolate and you
don't like dark chocolate.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2730-0
00:20:33.159 --> 00:20:37.496
<v Westman, Claire>So some of these things that we consider
to be knowledge. So I might say,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2730-1
00:20:37.496 --> 00:20:39.079
<v Westman, Claire>I know that dark chocolate.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2732-0
00:20:39.469 --> 00:20:40.349
<v Westman, Claire>Is delicious.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2745-0
00:20:41.759 --> 00:20:43.399
<v K KAWUTA>I am so sorry. No understand.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2760-0
00:20:41.919 --> 00:20:45.123
<v Westman, Claire>But to you,
because of our subjective experiences,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2760-1
00:20:45.123 --> 00:20:48.640
<v Westman, Claire>you would say no,
you don't know that dark chocolate is</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2760-2
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.719
<v Westman, Claire>delicious because you don't like dark
chocolate.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2763-0
00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:53.999
<v Westman, Claire>OK so.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2791-0
00:20:56.069 --> 00:21:01.630
<v Westman, Claire>So because of the subjectivity,
because of different experiences,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2791-1
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:07.949
<v Westman, Claire>because there's this change and this
decay and this deceptive appearances.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2804-0
00:21:08.189 --> 00:21:13.429
<v Westman, Claire>That is why Plato says that the things
that we experience are not true knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2822-0
00:21:14.959 --> 00:21:20.733
<v Westman, Claire>So he argues.
Or he argued that there is a world or a</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2822-1
00:21:20.733 --> 00:21:25.439
<v Westman, Claire>realm in which stable, perfect,
unchanging.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2829-0
00:21:25.709 --> 00:21:31.029
<v Westman, Claire>Universal objects exist and these.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2846-0
00:21:33.079 --> 00:21:36.233
<v Westman, Claire>Are behind the changing object objects of
our scene's experience,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2846-1
00:21:36.233 --> 00:21:38.479
<v Westman, Claire>so we're going to look at that a bit more
now.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2857-0
00:21:38.959 --> 00:21:44.679
<v Westman, Claire>So he says that there's this realm that
exists beyond the human.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2864-0
00:21:50.119 --> 00:21:52.359
<v Westman, Claire>But he says the recording has stopped
again.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2866-0
00:21:54.699 --> 00:21:54.819
<v Westman, Claire>Umm.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2870-0
00:21:57.159 --> 00:21:57.559
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2871-0
00:21:57.559 --> 00:21:58.439
<v Westman, Claire>I'm not sure.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2875-0
00:22:00.439 --> 00:22:02.239
<v Westman, Claire>Why it says that?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2883-0
00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:07.119
<v Westman, Claire>Because it's still showing on mine that
it's recording.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2899-0
00:22:10.589 --> 00:22:12.898
<v Westman, Claire>I'm sorry,
I don't know what's going on today and</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2899-1
00:22:12.898 --> 00:22:15.069
<v Westman, Claire>I'm getting very distracted by the chat
again.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2911-0
00:22:16.469 --> 00:22:22.029
<v Westman, Claire>Can you just give me a thumbs up?
If you can see it's recording?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2915-0
00:22:26.569 --> 00:22:28.929
<v Westman, Claire>OK, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2918-0
00:22:28.929 --> 00:22:29.289
<v Westman, Claire>All right.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2921-0
00:22:29.289 --> 00:22:30.609
<v Westman, Claire>Still recording on your side, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2936-0
00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:35.186
<v Westman, Claire>Sorry everyone,
I just wanted to stop recording and then</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2936-1
00:22:35.186 --> 00:22:36.929
<v Westman, Claire>people miss out. OK, so.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2951-0
00:22:38.719 --> 00:22:41.759
<v Westman, Claire>He says this this world of experiences is
not true knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2965-0
00:22:41.959 --> 00:22:48.330
<v Westman, Claire>True knowledge exists in this realm that
is beyond the human experience and beyond,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2965-1
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.999
<v Westman, Claire>beyond the human mind.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2983-0
00:22:49.999 --> 00:22:54.554
<v Westman, Claire>And this is the world of the forms,
or the realm of the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2983-1
00:22:54.554 --> 00:22:57.519
<v Westman, Claire>And in this realm of the forms there are.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2995-0
00:22:57.669 --> 00:23:04.282
<v Westman, Claire>These perfect,
unchanging universal objects or things</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/2995-1
00:23:04.282 --> 00:23:05.629
<v Westman, Claire>that exist.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3005-0
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:11.629
<v Westman, Claire>And those what we see in the world are
simply.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3008-0
00:23:13.239 --> 00:23:14.439
<v Westman, Claire>Reflections or.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3017-0
00:23:17.079 --> 00:23:20.119
<v Westman, Claire>Instances of those forms OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3038-0
00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:25.058
<v Westman, Claire>So this is maybe a bit confusing,
but we're going to look at the forms and</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3038-1
00:23:25.058 --> 00:23:27.759
<v Westman, Claire>then we will we'll look at it a bit more.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3054-0
00:23:27.959 --> 00:23:32.355
<v Westman, Claire>So he says that philosophers in
particular need to engage in the pursuit</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3054-1
00:23:32.355 --> 00:23:33.439
<v Westman, Claire>of this knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3056-0
00:23:33.439 --> 00:23:36.879
<v Westman, Claire>He says everybody should work towards.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3077-0
00:23:37.229 --> 00:23:41.493
<v Westman, Claire>Towards attaining knowledge of the forms,
however,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3077-1
00:23:41.493 --> 00:23:47.680
<v Westman, Claire>he doesn't believe that everybody can
work towards knowledge of the forms</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3077-2
00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.349
<v Westman, Claire>because.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3092-0
00:23:50.639 --> 00:23:57.079
<v Westman, Claire>He he doesn't think that everybody is
capable of that, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3097-0
00:23:57.519 --> 00:24:01.439
<v Westman, Claire>So he says that not everyone is able to.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3105-0
00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:05.439
<v Westman, Claire>Really engage in the pursuit of knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3108-0
00:24:06.249 --> 00:24:07.489
<v Westman, Claire>Of real knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3139-0
00:24:08.999 --> 00:24:13.639
<v Westman, Claire>Because it's some people are distracted
by the Saints experiences.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3139-1
00:24:13.639 --> 00:24:18.764
<v Westman, Claire>Some people don't use their reason and
their rational mind enough to work</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3139-2
00:24:18.764 --> 00:24:21.119
<v Westman, Claire>towards that pursuit of knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3144-0
00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:24.599
<v Westman, Claire>Some people are scared of the pursuits of
knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3168-0
00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:32.055
<v Westman, Claire>So he thinks that it's only philosophers
or people with philosophical minds that</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3168-1
00:24:32.055 --> 00:24:35.479
<v Westman, Claire>can truly engage in trying to attain
knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3178-0
00:24:36.469 --> 00:24:39.549
<v Westman, Claire>But that we should all work towards it in
any case.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3180-0
00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:41.319
<v Westman, Claire>So.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3182-0
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.949
<v Westman, Claire>The.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3184-0
00:24:46.719 --> 00:24:46.919
<v Westman, Claire>Forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3213-0
00:24:47.949 --> 00:24:52.920
<v Westman, Claire>So like I said,
the forms exist in this realm that Plato</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3213-1
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:59.549
<v Westman, Claire>believes is independent of our experience
and it's independent of our mind.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3223-0
00:24:59.549 --> 00:25:02.989
<v Westman, Claire>So he says the forms have an objective
existence.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3238-0
00:25:03.309 --> 00:25:09.924
<v Westman, Claire>So the the forms don't depend on our
minds or on our experiences.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3238-1
00:25:09.924 --> 00:25:12.229
<v Westman, Claire>He believes they exist.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3252-0
00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:17.564
<v Westman, Claire>On their own,
as separate from our experiences and</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3252-1
00:25:17.564 --> 00:25:19.429
<v Westman, Claire>separate from our mind.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3254-0
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:22.389
<v Westman, Claire>However.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3295-0
00:25:23.759 --> 00:25:29.400
<v Westman, Claire>They are not ideas or concepts and This
is why he says they're separate from</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3295-1
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.796
<v Westman, Claire>almat because if he said if if they were
part of our minds,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3295-2
00:25:33.796 --> 00:25:38.559
<v Westman, Claire>then they are ideas or concepts that are
developed by our minds.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3313-0
00:25:38.759 --> 00:25:42.486
<v Westman, Claire>But he says they exist independently of
the human mind,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3313-1
00:25:42.486 --> 00:25:47.679
<v Westman, Claire>though they don't come from the human
mind. They already exist in this realm.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3316-0
00:25:48.879 --> 00:25:49.959
<v Westman, Claire>Beyond the mind.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3323-0
00:25:50.429 --> 00:25:55.069
<v Westman, Claire>Beyond the world we experience beyond.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3335-0
00:25:56.479 --> 00:26:00.799
<v Westman, Claire>Our minds,
so they are separate from us as humans.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3340-0
00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:01.519
<v Westman, Claire>They exist.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3342-0
00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:03.479
<v Westman, Claire>They're independently on their own.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3373-0
00:26:05.599 --> 00:26:11.176
<v Westman, Claire>But it is only through the mind and
through using rationality and reason,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3373-1
00:26:11.176 --> 00:26:14.643
<v Westman, Claire>that we can pursue knowledge of what is
real.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3373-2
00:26:14.643 --> 00:26:17.959
<v Westman, Claire>And this is what Plato is called a
realist.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3390-0
00:26:18.349 --> 00:26:25.419
<v Westman, Claire>Because he believed that we had to use
reason and rationality and the mind in</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3390-1
00:26:25.419 --> 00:26:28.229
<v Westman, Claire>order to discover what is real.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3398-0
00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:30.429
<v Westman, Claire>You might have seen already that for
Plato.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3408-0
00:26:30.509 --> 00:26:35.349
<v Westman, Claire>Sorry for Aristotle.
For example he believed in.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3433-0
00:26:37.199 --> 00:26:40.706
<v Westman, Claire>He believed that we learned through our
Saints experiences.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3433-1
00:26:40.706 --> 00:26:45.266
<v Westman, Claire>So Aristotle believed that we needed to
experience things in order to develop</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3433-2
00:26:45.266 --> 00:26:46.319
<v Westman, Claire>knowledge of them.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3435-0
00:26:46.399 --> 00:26:47.319
<v Westman, Claire>But for Plato.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3445-0
00:26:48.309 --> 00:26:51.149
<v Westman, Claire>Our sense experiences don't give us real
knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3454-0
00:26:51.149 --> 00:26:56.482
<v Westman, Claire>As I've said,
it's our mind working in pursuit of</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3454-1
00:26:56.482 --> 00:26:57.549
<v Westman, Claire>knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3480-0
00:26:59.189 --> 00:27:06.554
<v Westman, Claire>And using reason in order to try and
pursue knowledge that we can try and gain</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3480-1
00:27:06.554 --> 00:27:12.149
<v Westman, Claire>real knowledge of the forms that exist
independent from us.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3487-0
00:27:12.349 --> 00:27:15.189
<v Westman, Claire>So knowledge can only be accessed through
reason.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3503-0
00:27:16.599 --> 00:27:20.727
<v Westman, Claire>So in order to understand that though,
we need to understand that for Plato,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3503-1
00:27:20.727 --> 00:27:21.639
<v Westman, Claire>he was a dualist.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3511-0
00:27:21.759 --> 00:27:28.039
<v Westman, Claire>So he believed that there was a soul that
was separate from the the body.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3541-0
00:27:29.199 --> 00:27:34.902
<v Westman, Claire>So he believed that humans had a body and
a brain, but then,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3541-1
00:27:34.902 --> 00:27:42.570
<v Westman, Claire>separate from that was a soul that exists
independently of and is superior to the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3541-2
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:43.879
<v Westman, Claire>material body.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3545-0
00:27:43.879 --> 00:27:44.319
<v Westman, Claire>Oh, I see.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3547-0
00:27:44.319 --> 00:27:44.719
<v Westman, Claire>I made a.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3558-0
00:27:47.439 --> 00:27:50.319
<v Westman, Claire>Sorry, I see I made a little tarpa there.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3565-0
00:27:50.479 --> 00:27:52.879
<v Westman, Claire>Superior to material, the body I wrote.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3566-0
00:27:52.879 --> 00:27:53.719
<v Westman, Claire>I'll fix it.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3574-0
00:27:54.119 --> 00:27:57.919
<v Westman, Claire>The soul is independent of and superior
to the material body.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3588-0
00:27:58.429 --> 00:28:02.949
<v Westman, Claire>So he and some of you might have this
belief as well.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3605-0
00:28:02.989 --> 00:28:05.939
<v Westman, Claire>I mean,
this is quite a a common belief that</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3605-1
00:28:05.939 --> 00:28:10.069
<v Westman, Claire>people believe that you have a soul,
that that lives on after.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3612-0
00:28:11.599 --> 00:28:13.439
<v Westman, Claire>Your material body dies, for example.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3629-0
00:28:15.079 --> 00:28:19.279
<v Westman, Claire>So that's kind of the idea that Plato had
that we had this body that could</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3629-1
00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:22.359
<v Westman, Claire>experience things,
but then beyond that we had a soul.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3647-0
00:28:23.229 --> 00:28:27.909
<v Westman, Claire>And he thought that the soul belongs to
the world or the realm of the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3668-0
00:28:28.189 --> 00:28:34.124
<v Westman, Claire>So he said that sometimes when we might
die and our soul might return to the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3668-1
00:28:34.124 --> 00:28:35.589
<v Westman, Claire>world of the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3669-0
00:28:35.829 --> 00:28:38.149
<v Westman, Claire>And that's why when.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3696-0
00:28:40.239 --> 00:28:43.220
<v Westman, Claire>We are born and as we go through our
lives,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3696-1
00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.742
<v Westman, Claire>we are able to work towards knowledge of
the forms,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3696-2
00:28:46.742 --> 00:28:49.791
<v Westman, Claire>because our soul already has some
knowledge,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3696-3
00:28:49.791 --> 00:28:51.959
<v Westman, Claire>some understanding of the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3704-0
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:53.989
<v Westman, Claire>So it recollects.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3708-0
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:57.109
<v Westman, Claire>So he's got the idea of recollection.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3721-0
00:28:58.599 --> 00:29:04.599
<v Westman, Claire>The soul has already this kind of
knowledge, some knowledge of the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3744-0
00:29:06.239 --> 00:29:12.069
<v Westman, Claire>And that is how we can have an idea that
the forms exist and how we can work</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3744-1
00:29:12.069 --> 00:29:14.719
<v Westman, Claire>towards the knowledge of the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3758-0
00:29:15.239 --> 00:29:20.966
<v Westman, Claire>But he says that when our soul comes back
from the world of the forms that</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3758-1
00:29:20.966 --> 00:29:22.799
<v Westman, Claire>corrupted by our senses.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3771-0
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:28.869
<v Westman, Claire>Experiences.
So it forgets what the forms are exactly.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3789-0
00:29:28.869 --> 00:29:34.949
<v Westman, Claire>So it doesn't have full knowledge of the
form of full recollection of the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3811-0
00:29:35.109 --> 00:29:40.266
<v Westman, Claire>It has an imperfect or a diminished
recollection of the forms,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3811-1
00:29:40.266 --> 00:29:46.406
<v Westman, Claire>and that's why then we have to work
towards attaining the knowledge of the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3811-2
00:29:46.406 --> 00:29:47.389
<v Westman, Claire>forms again.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3822-0
00:29:48.199 --> 00:29:52.599
<v Westman, Claire>But he says again that this is only
possible because we have a soul.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3862-0
00:29:53.829 --> 00:29:59.464
<v Westman, Claire>That is independent of our material
bodies and he believes that the soul is</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3862-1
00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:04.877
<v Westman, Claire>superior to the material body.
He places more emphasis on the importance</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3862-2
00:30:04.877 --> 00:30:10.882
<v Westman, Claire>of the soul and the mind. As you can see,
than he does on a physical world and a</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3862-3
00:30:10.882 --> 00:30:12.069
<v Westman, Claire>physical bodies.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3864-0
00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:13.719
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3888-0
00:30:14.469 --> 00:30:20.791
<v Westman, Claire>So the forms are these objects,
these things that exist independently in</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3888-1
00:30:20.791 --> 00:30:23.909
<v Westman, Claire>the realm of the world of the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3894-0
00:30:24.829 --> 00:30:27.549
<v Westman, Claire>And they are universal. So.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3900-0
00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:30.879
<v Westman, Claire>He says that they have.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3917-0
00:30:30.879 --> 00:30:36.799
<v Westman, Claire>They are a general term that applies to a
property that is common to many objects.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3920-0
00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:38.799
<v Westman, Claire>So I'll give you an example now.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3958-0
00:30:40.189 --> 00:30:43.454
<v Westman, Claire>So in order to know what something is
like,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3958-1
00:30:43.454 --> 00:30:49.318
<v Westman, Claire>we further we need to have knowledge of
the universals that are independent of</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3958-2
00:30:49.318 --> 00:30:53.029
<v Westman, Claire>all prior to our sense perceptions of
that thing.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3963-0
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:55.509
<v Westman, Claire>OK, I'm going to give you an example.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3972-0
00:30:55.509 --> 00:30:57.149
<v Westman, Claire>Then you can think about this again.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3976-0
00:30:57.589 --> 00:31:02.469
<v Westman, Claire>The particulars, however,
are what we experience.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3987-0
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:06.189
<v Westman, Claire>So the universals are in the world of the
forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3994-0
00:31:07.159 --> 00:31:09.639
<v Westman, Claire>The particulars are the things that we.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/3999-0
00:31:09.829 --> 00:31:11.549
<v Westman, Claire>Experience or perceive?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4005-0
00:31:13.159 --> 00:31:14.399
<v Westman, Claire>In our material world.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4028-0
00:31:14.399 --> 00:31:22.200
<v Westman, Claire>So these are specific instances of things
and it is not true knowledge because it</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4028-1
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.959
<v Westman, Claire>is imperfect and impermanent.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4030-0
00:31:25.479 --> 00:31:27.279
<v Westman, Claire>So let me give you an example.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4054-0
00:31:28.709 --> 00:31:32.735
<v Westman, Claire>We're walking along the road and we see a
dock. OK,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4054-1
00:31:32.735 --> 00:31:39.084
<v Westman, Claire>so we can sense particular things about
that dog that makes us believe that it is</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4054-2
00:31:39.084 --> 00:31:39.549
<v Westman, Claire>a dog.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4060-0
00:31:41.449 --> 00:31:43.129
<v Westman, Claire>We can feel their fur.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4078-0
00:31:43.609 --> 00:31:47.526
<v Westman, Claire>We maybe we hear them bark if we put our
face close to these,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4078-1
00:31:47.526 --> 00:31:49.169
<v Westman, Claire>we can smell their breath.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4081-0
00:31:49.809 --> 00:31:51.529
<v Westman, Claire>We think about that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4091-0
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:54.289
<v Westman, Claire>They have we. Well,
we can see that they have 4 legs.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4098-0
00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:57.009
<v Westman, Claire>They have a tail, they have ears.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4111-0
00:31:57.329 --> 00:32:04.422
<v Westman, Claire>So when we put that information together
based on what we know about dogs,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4111-1
00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:06.409
<v Westman, Claire>we believe that they.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4115-0
00:32:07.119 --> 00:32:07.999
<v Westman, Claire>That that is a dog.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4118-0
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.669
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4133-0
00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:17.095
<v Westman, Claire>So we have these idea.
We already have this idea of universal</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4133-1
00:32:17.095 --> 00:32:18.349
<v Westman, Claire>properties.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4149-0
00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:23.319
<v Westman, Claire>Of a doc. OK,
so we might say to ourselves,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4149-1
00:32:23.319 --> 00:32:24.439
<v Westman, Claire>a dog has fur.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4164-0
00:32:24.599 --> 00:32:28.879
<v Westman, Claire>A dog can bark. A dog has four legs.
A dog has ears.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4172-0
00:32:28.919 --> 00:32:34.439
<v Westman, Claire>A dog has a tail,
so we have these general terms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4189-0
00:32:36.589 --> 00:32:42.487
<v Westman, Claire>That say that dogs have food, OK,
and then we think it.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4189-1
00:32:42.487 --> 00:32:46.069
<v Westman, Claire>Then there would be a form of dog.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4199-0
00:32:47.559 --> 00:32:51.839
<v Westman, Claire>And the dogs that we see that we can
sense.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4201-0
00:32:53.559 --> 00:32:53.679
<v Westman, Claire>Are.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4204-0
00:32:54.899 --> 00:32:56.259
<v Westman, Claire>Instances.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4220-0
00:32:58.199 --> 00:33:02.479
<v Westman, Claire>Of the universals that would apply to the
term doc, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4232-0
00:33:02.759 --> 00:33:07.438
<v Westman, Claire>But now remember,
he says that this isn't we don't have</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4232-1
00:33:07.438 --> 00:33:10.279
<v Westman, Claire>true knowledge of dogness because.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4239-0
00:33:11.739 --> 00:33:15.699
<v Westman, Claire>This dog is imperfect and impermanent.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4241-0
00:33:15.699 --> 00:33:16.539
<v Westman, Claire>It can change.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4258-0
00:33:19.439 --> 00:33:22.741
<v Westman, Claire>So over time,
maybe we keep seeing that dog and they're</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4258-1
00:33:22.741 --> 00:33:24.039
<v Westman, Claire>changing all the time.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4259-0
00:33:24.039 --> 00:33:26.239
<v Westman, Claire>Their fur changes colour.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4268-0
00:33:26.679 --> 00:33:29.919
<v Westman, Claire>Maybe they have an accident and they lose
a leg.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4275-0
00:33:30.119 --> 00:33:33.359
<v Westman, Claire>Their breast might become smellier as
they get older.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4277-0
00:33:35.239 --> 00:33:35.319
<v Westman, Claire>Or.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4291-0
00:33:36.479 --> 00:33:42.017
<v Westman, Claire>We might see another dog now.
We still think that's a dog because it's</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4291-1
00:33:42.017 --> 00:33:42.719
<v Westman, Claire>got legs.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4299-0
00:33:42.719 --> 00:33:44.999
<v Westman, Claire>It's got a tail, it's got ears,
it's got fur.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4320-0
00:33:45.199 --> 00:33:51.727
<v Westman, Claire>It conforms to our beliefs about a dog,
but it's got a it's got different kind of</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4320-1
00:33:51.727 --> 00:33:53.479
<v Westman, Claire>food to the first dog.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4330-0
00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:56.359
<v Westman, Claire>They're a different size to the first dog.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4343-0
00:33:56.359 --> 00:34:02.208
<v Westman, Claire>Their bark sounds different,
so we can't then say that we have</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4343-1
00:34:02.208 --> 00:34:03.879
<v Westman, Claire>knowledge of dogs.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4363-0
00:34:05.429 --> 00:34:09.463
<v Westman, Claire>As a form,
because the things that we are perceiving</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4363-1
00:34:09.463 --> 00:34:13.269
<v Westman, Claire>and experiencing are changing,
they're different.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4365-0
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:15.829
<v Westman, Claire>So there is imperfect.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4377-0
00:34:17.439 --> 00:34:21.679
<v Westman, Claire>Let's say examples or instances of the
form of the dog.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4408-0
00:34:24.229 --> 00:34:28.954
<v Westman, Claire>But we believe they are dogs,
so that is why Plato says that the things</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4408-1
00:34:28.954 --> 00:34:33.549
<v Westman, Claire>we can perceive, our beliefs or opinions,
they're not true knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4415-0
00:34:33.749 --> 00:34:36.589
<v Westman, Claire>So we are taking the information that we
have.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4433-0
00:34:38.319 --> 00:34:43.958
<v Westman, Claire>And applying it to these particular
instances or examples and forming beliefs</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4433-1
00:34:43.958 --> 00:34:46.199
<v Westman, Claire>or opinions about those things.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4449-0
00:34:46.519 --> 00:34:51.012
<v Westman, Claire>But we would need to have.
We need to work towards that true</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4449-1
00:34:51.012 --> 00:34:53.959
<v Westman, Claire>knowledge of the form of the dog, which.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4460-0
00:34:54.309 --> 00:34:59.469
<v Westman, Claire>Which would be the perfect,
unchanging universal dog.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4475-0
00:35:00.309 --> 00:35:05.589
<v Westman, Claire>In order to have true knowledge of dog or
of dogness as he might say it.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4488-0
00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:09.839
<v Westman, Claire>So we only have an idea of what a dog is.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4494-0
00:35:10.519 --> 00:35:15.079
<v Westman, Claire>Not exactly what not true knowledge of
what a dog is.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4497-0
00:35:15.319 --> 00:35:15.519
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4503-0
00:35:15.919 --> 00:35:18.999
<v Westman, Claire>So I hope that's making some sense for
you.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4506-0
00:35:18.999 --> 00:35:21.759
<v Westman, Claire>So just remember the forms are universal.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4517-0
00:35:23.439 --> 00:35:27.839
<v Westman, Claire>And they are forms that correlate to
basically everything.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4519-0
00:35:29.479 --> 00:35:29.719
<v Westman, Claire>So.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4528-0
00:35:30.029 --> 00:35:32.389
<v Westman, Claire>We might say this, the form of a dog.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4534-0
00:35:32.389 --> 00:35:33.629
<v Westman, Claire>This the form of a cat.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4538-0
00:35:33.629 --> 00:35:35.069
<v Westman, Claire>There's the form of the table.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4541-0
00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:36.349
<v Westman, Claire>There's the form of a box.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4557-0
00:35:37.879 --> 00:35:42.577
<v Westman, Claire>There's the form of also things that we
that are not physical but that we can</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4557-1
00:35:42.577 --> 00:35:43.119
<v Westman, Claire>perceive.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4572-0
00:35:43.159 --> 00:35:47.032
<v Westman, Claire>So things like form of justice,
form of beauty.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4572-1
00:35:47.032 --> 00:35:52.519
<v Westman, Claire>So we might say that we'll look at an
example now actually of that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4588-0
00:35:54.319 --> 00:35:59.197
<v Westman, Claire>And in the particulars. Sorry,
are the things that we experience,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4588-1
00:35:59.197 --> 00:36:01.119
<v Westman, Claire>the examples or instances?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4602-0
00:36:03.029 --> 00:36:11.269
<v Westman, Claire>When we when we say that we have a belief
or an opinion or an idea that something.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4612-0
00:36:12.619 --> 00:36:18.419
<v Westman, Claire>Is what we think it is because of the
characteristics.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4621-0
00:36:19.879 --> 00:36:22.999
<v Westman, Claire>Of the particular attributes that that
thing has.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4633-0
00:36:23.239 --> 00:36:25.997
<v Westman, Claire>So again,
I might say something like the example</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4633-1
00:36:25.997 --> 00:36:27.799
<v Westman, Claire>that's given in the study guide.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4640-0
00:36:28.159 --> 00:36:30.399
<v Westman, Claire>You can look at something and say OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4641-0
00:36:30.399 --> 00:36:33.159
<v Westman, Claire>It's square, it's brown.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4647-0
00:36:33.319 --> 00:36:35.359
<v Westman, Claire>You could put things inside of it.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4657-0
00:36:37.159 --> 00:36:39.799
<v Westman, Claire>It's got a lid. Sorry.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4661-0
00:36:39.799 --> 00:36:41.199
<v Westman, Claire>So then we might say, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4685-0
00:36:42.469 --> 00:36:46.983
<v Westman, Claire>Because of those characteristics and
those attributes or those properties of</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4685-1
00:36:46.983 --> 00:36:51.029
<v Westman, Claire>that thing we're looking at,
we can say it's a box, but they're not.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4688-0
00:36:51.029 --> 00:36:52.509
<v Westman, Claire>All boxes are brown.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4703-0
00:36:53.029 --> 00:36:59.366
<v Westman, Claire>Maybe not all boxes are square,
so we don't have true knowledge of a box</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4703-1
00:36:59.366 --> 00:37:00.669
<v Westman, Claire>of box because.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4712-0
00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:05.359
<v Westman, Claire>We are seeing examples that are changing
and different.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4725-0
00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:10.319
<v Westman, Claire>They have these particular attributes or
characteristics that we think of as a box.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4744-0
00:37:10.989 --> 00:37:17.189
<v Westman, Claire>But they're not that perfect. Universal,
unchanging form of box. OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4758-0
00:37:17.189 --> 00:37:21.566
<v Westman, Claire>So let's look here at this diagram which
I have borrowed from the source at the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4758-1
00:37:21.566 --> 00:37:21.949
<v Westman, Claire>bottom.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4769-0
00:37:23.679 --> 00:37:29.999
<v Westman, Claire>And so this gives you a very basic sort
of breakdown of.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4780-0
00:37:32.919 --> 00:37:36.839
<v Westman, Claire>The Plato's ideas of forms and the
physical realm.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4783-0
00:37:38.399 --> 00:37:39.599
<v Westman, Claire>You, you'll see.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4798-0
00:37:39.869 --> 00:37:42.572
<v Westman, Claire>If you go and look on Google,
if you Google it,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4798-1
00:37:42.572 --> 00:37:45.389
<v Westman, Claire>you'll see there's more complex versions
of this.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4808-0
00:37:45.389 --> 00:37:50.229
<v Westman, Claire>But again,
I don't want to go too in depth into this.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4819-0
00:37:50.229 --> 00:37:55.462
<v Westman, Claire>We can come back to it because I just
want you to be able to get question three</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4819-1
00:37:55.462 --> 00:37:55.789
<v Westman, Claire>done.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4821-0
00:37:58.739 --> 00:38:00.059
<v Westman, Claire>So that you can.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4827-0
00:38:01.559 --> 00:38:03.119
<v Westman, Claire>Your brain hurts, don't worry.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4837-0
00:38:03.199 --> 00:38:06.319
<v Westman, Claire>I'm sure a lot of people's brains are but
fried right now.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4843-0
00:38:06.399 --> 00:38:08.839
<v Westman, Claire>Alejandra,
do you have a question before I continue?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4848-0
00:38:12.609 --> 00:38:14.489
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>Yes, ma'am. I just.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4858-0
00:38:15.909 --> 00:38:17.709
<v Westman, Claire>Somebody's mark is on hold on.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4859-0
00:38:16.039 --> 00:38:17.479
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>Wanted to ask in a way where.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4870-0
00:38:20.119 --> 00:38:22.244
<v Westman, Claire>Leanne,
I'm just going to mute you and you can</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4870-1
00:38:22.244 --> 00:38:23.239
<v Westman, Claire>unmute yourself again.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4876-0
00:38:23.999 --> 00:38:26.091
<v Westman, Claire>OK,
you can unmute yourself again and ask a</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4876-1
00:38:26.091 --> 00:38:26.519
<v Westman, Claire>question.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4878-0
00:38:30.059 --> 00:38:30.699
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4880-0
00:38:32.199 --> 00:38:32.479
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4883-0
00:38:32.679 --> 00:38:34.119
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>So what?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4886-0
00:38:35.269 --> 00:38:35.669
<v Westman, Claire>Oh wait.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4897-0
00:38:35.709 --> 00:38:39.069
<v Westman, Claire>Oh, I think sorry. Sorry.
My sound was off. Sorry.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4893-0
00:38:35.919 --> 00:38:36.279
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>So I kind of.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4899-0
00:38:40.269 --> 00:38:40.869
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4921-0
00:38:43.239 --> 00:38:47.251
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>So basically what Plato was saying,
I'm just trying to see if I understand</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4921-1
00:38:47.251 --> 00:38:47.519
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>this.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4925-0
00:38:47.519 --> 00:38:50.799
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>So basically what Plato is saying is that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4920-0
00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:48.789
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4950-0
00:38:52.839 --> 00:38:57.513
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>Nothing is true or real because it can
take many different forms,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4950-1
00:38:57.513 --> 00:39:03.392
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>so there isn't 1U criteria of something,
and because there isn't their fault can't</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4950-2
00:39:03.392 --> 00:39:03.959
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>be real.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4953-0
00:39:05.569 --> 00:39:06.689
<v Westman, Claire>Yes, basically.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4974-0
00:39:06.729 --> 00:39:10.362
<v Westman, Claire>So he's saying that the things that we
experience, remember,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/4974-1
00:39:10.362 --> 00:39:14.889
<v Westman, Claire>we don't all experience things the same.
Not everything that we experience.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5011-0
00:39:16.599 --> 00:39:20.955
<v Westman, Claire>Will conform 100% to our idea of. Again,
let's say with the dog.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5011-1
00:39:20.955 --> 00:39:26.251
<v Westman, Claire>We might say that dogs have four legs,
but maybe we come across a dog that has</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5011-2
00:39:26.251 --> 00:39:28.999
<v Westman, Claire>three legs or two legs or whatever it is.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5015-0
00:39:29.159 --> 00:39:31.959
<v Westman, Claire>So because those things.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5019-0
00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:35.079
<v Westman, Claire>Because the things we experience are.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5027-0
00:39:35.959 --> 00:39:39.239
<v Westman, Claire>Not identical all the time they're
changing.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5035-0
00:39:41.079 --> 00:39:42.839
<v Westman, Claire>They they are not true.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5041-0
00:39:42.839 --> 00:39:45.719
<v Westman, Claire>They're not true knowledge of those
things because.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5046-0
00:39:47.479 --> 00:39:48.879
<v Westman, Claire>They are not always the same.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5052-0
00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:51.239
<v Westman, Claire>They're not eternal,
they're not universal.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5063-0
00:39:52.799 --> 00:39:54.651
<v Westman, Claire>OK,
so you seem to be on the right track</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5063-1
00:39:54.651 --> 00:39:55.239
<v Westman, Claire>there though.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5065-0
00:39:56.989 --> 00:39:57.589
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5067-0
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:58.469
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>Thank you.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5072-0
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:02.149
<v Westman, Claire>All right, so let's look here.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5074-0
00:40:02.149 --> 00:40:02.949
<v Westman, Claire>We see.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5082-0
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:09.189
<v Westman, Claire>We see at the very top is the form of
beauty.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5085-0
00:40:09.549 --> 00:40:09.749
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5099-0
00:40:09.749 --> 00:40:15.549
<v Westman, Claire>So this so if if it helps you to think of
it, I do sometimes as well.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5115-0
00:40:15.619 --> 00:40:19.828
<v Westman, Claire>So I sometimes think of the world of the
forms as out there in the clouds.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5115-1
00:40:19.828 --> 00:40:22.859
<v Westman, Claire>Like you can see it here in this image,
this picture.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5130-0
00:40:24.709 --> 00:40:29.109
<v Westman, Claire>The form of beauty is out there beyond
our world, OK?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5134-0
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:31.149
<v Westman, Claire>It's beyond our mind.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5138-0
00:40:31.149 --> 00:40:33.189
<v Westman, Claire>It's beyond our physical world.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5146-0
00:40:33.229 --> 00:40:37.709
<v Westman, Claire>It exists in a realm in a world beyond us.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5154-0
00:40:39.469 --> 00:40:40.789
<v Westman, Claire>And that is the form of beauty.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5160-0
00:40:40.789 --> 00:40:44.829
<v Westman, Claire>So that is the perfect, unchanging,
eternal.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5164-0
00:40:45.479 --> 00:40:47.919
<v Westman, Claire>Universal form of beauty.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5172-0
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:51.229
<v Westman, Claire>Then we get this.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5182-0
00:40:51.269 --> 00:40:55.829
<v Westman, Claire>Then we get in the next realm is the
concept of beauty.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5186-0
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:57.349
<v Westman, Claire>And now for Plato.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5218-0
00:40:57.389 --> 00:41:02.455
<v Westman, Claire>These are the higher realms because
remember he puts reason and rationality</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5218-1
00:41:02.455 --> 00:41:06.922
<v Westman, Claire>above the material world.
So in our minds we can think of the idea</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5218-2
00:41:06.922 --> 00:41:08.589
<v Westman, Claire>or the concept of beauty.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5221-0
00:41:08.669 --> 00:41:11.109
<v Westman, Claire>So you might think to yourself about what?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5228-0
00:41:12.789 --> 00:41:14.309
<v Westman, Claire>In your mind, constitutes beauty.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5253-0
00:41:15.779 --> 00:41:20.110
<v Westman, Claire>But for Plato,
that is not the true form of beauty,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5253-1
00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:24.859
<v Westman, Claire>because we have different ideas about
what is beautiful.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5266-0
00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:31.155
<v Westman, Claire>We there are different properties or
characteristics that we might have about</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5266-1
00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:31.699
<v Westman, Claire>beauty.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5277-0
00:41:33.709 --> 00:41:37.298
<v Westman, Claire>OK.
Then we have individual beautiful</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5277-1
00:41:37.298 --> 00:41:38.149
<v Westman, Claire>entities.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5287-0
00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:43.709
<v Westman, Claire>So here we can see this is a bit
misogynistic, but we've got a woman.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5293-0
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:47.509
<v Westman, Claire>We've got a Vaz, we've got nature.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5302-0
00:41:47.859 --> 00:41:52.499
<v Westman, Claire>We've got flowers,
so these are individual entities.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5304-0
00:41:53.909 --> 00:41:54.229
<v Westman, Claire>Examples.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5326-0
00:41:56.469 --> 00:42:00.604
<v Westman, Claire>Individual things that we can experience
as beautiful, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5326-1
00:42:00.604 --> 00:42:04.389
<v Westman, Claire>And now these are things that we might
consider real.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5333-0
00:42:04.389 --> 00:42:06.869
<v Westman, Claire>But according to Plato, they are not real.
OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5336-0
00:42:07.189 --> 00:42:13.709
<v Westman, Claire>These are instances of things that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5343-0
00:42:15.429 --> 00:42:17.589
<v Westman, Claire>Have attributes of the form of beauty.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5351-0
00:42:18.459 --> 00:42:22.059
<v Westman, Claire>But are not beauty itself KK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5362-0
00:42:23.179 --> 00:42:28.419
<v Westman, Claire>Then below that is imitations of
beautiful entities.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5386-0
00:42:28.419 --> 00:42:33.252
<v Westman, Claire>So again, in your answer,
don't go into too much detail about this,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5386-1
00:42:33.252 --> 00:42:37.517
<v Westman, Claire>but I just want this.
I think often gives students a better</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5386-2
00:42:37.517 --> 00:42:38.939
<v Westman, Claire>understanding of it.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5399-0
00:42:39.339 --> 00:42:47.979
<v Westman, Claire>So he says that we have actual physical
examples or instances of beautiful things.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5413-0
00:42:48.709 --> 00:42:51.745
<v Westman, Claire>But then beyond that,
we get imitations of them,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5413-1
00:42:51.745 --> 00:42:53.109
<v Westman, Claire>which might be photos.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5422-0
00:42:53.939 --> 00:42:56.899
<v Westman, Claire>Reflection, shadows, paintings, etc. OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5443-0
00:42:57.819 --> 00:43:02.919
<v Westman, Claire>So we have these different levels of,
let's say realness,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5443-1
00:43:02.919 --> 00:43:08.459
<v Westman, Claire>and but the only true real thing is the
actual form of beauty.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5451-0
00:43:10.029 --> 00:43:11.829
<v Westman, Claire>I think you'd pronounce it Joaquim.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5454-0
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:12.869
<v Westman, Claire>Is that correct?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5457-0
00:43:13.229 --> 00:43:14.429
<v Westman, Claire>I see your hand is up.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5461-0
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:17.349
<v Westman, Claire>Please correct my pronunciation.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5472-0
00:43:22.969 --> 00:43:25.729
<v Westman, Claire>Looks like to talking,
but I can't hear you.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5476-0
00:43:30.259 --> 00:43:31.659
<v Westman, Claire>Is it just me? OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5478-0
00:43:38.329 --> 00:43:38.929
<v Westman, Claire>Oh, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5481-0
00:43:41.089 --> 00:43:41.409
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5486-0
00:43:41.769 --> 00:43:43.809
<v Westman, Claire>OK, then yeah, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5487-0
00:43:43.809 --> 00:43:44.769
<v Westman, Claire>Perfect. Alright.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5489-0
00:43:45.449 --> 00:43:45.769
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5499-0
00:43:45.929 --> 00:43:49.249
<v Westman, Claire>So let me again give you an example if
that will help you.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5514-0
00:43:49.249 --> 00:43:54.550
<v Westman, Claire>So you might let's think of a sunset,
we might say, oh,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5514-1
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:57.769
<v Westman, Claire>that's a beautiful sunset. So now.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5520-0
00:43:59.429 --> 00:44:00.869
<v Westman, Claire>We're we are applying.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5540-0
00:44:02.709 --> 00:44:06.124
<v Westman, Claire>Um,
what we consider attributes or</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5540-1
00:44:06.124 --> 00:44:11.589
<v Westman, Claire>characteristics of beauty to our
experience of the sun.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5550-0
00:44:12.059 --> 00:44:13.659
<v Westman, Claire>It so I look at the sunset.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5558-0
00:44:13.659 --> 00:44:17.059
<v Westman, Claire>I say wow, that is a beautiful sunset.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5576-0
00:44:17.299 --> 00:44:23.523
<v Westman, Claire>We're looking at particular aspects of it
that conform to our ideas of beauty,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5576-1
00:44:23.523 --> 00:44:27.699
<v Westman, Claire>so I might think it's beautiful because
it's bright.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5584-0
00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.299
<v Westman, Claire>There's so many different colors.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5591-0
00:44:30.299 --> 00:44:35.419
<v Westman, Claire>It's orange and yellow and red,
so it's really colorful.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5594-0
00:44:35.419 --> 00:44:37.419
<v Westman, Claire>So because of these things.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5601-0
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:41.869
<v Westman, Claire>That I think are what makes something.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5613-0
00:44:42.019 --> 00:44:45.259
<v Westman, Claire>Beautiful. Well,
that I think makes sunsets beautiful.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5642-0
00:44:45.299 --> 00:44:49.712
<v Westman, Claire>I think that's a beautiful sunset,
but then night closes in.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5642-1
00:44:49.712 --> 00:44:54.488
<v Westman, Claire>It gets later and later as time goes on.
As the night progresses,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5642-2
00:44:54.488 --> 00:44:56.659
<v Westman, Claire>the colors start to fade away.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5652-0
00:44:56.659 --> 00:44:59.219
<v Westman, Claire>There's no more Reds in the sunset.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5664-0
00:44:59.419 --> 00:45:04.059
<v Westman, Claire>It's now just becoming like a dull yellow,
and maybe I don't really like yellow so</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5664-1
00:45:04.059 --> 00:45:04.339
<v Westman, Claire>much.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5668-0
00:45:05.789 --> 00:45:06.669
<v Westman, Claire>The sky becomes dark.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5676-0
00:45:08.389 --> 00:45:10.549
<v Westman, Claire>And we start to lose those things.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5696-0
00:45:11.099 --> 00:45:14.717
<v Westman, Claire>That we think make the sunset beautiful,
or that I think,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5696-1
00:45:14.717 --> 00:45:16.339
<v Westman, Claire>make the sunset beautiful.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5713-0
00:45:16.539 --> 00:45:23.548
<v Westman, Claire>So the characteristics or attributes that
I associated with it as beautiful have</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5713-1
00:45:23.548 --> 00:45:25.539
<v Westman, Claire>changed or disappeared.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5720-0
00:45:25.859 --> 00:45:28.579
<v Westman, Claire>So I cannot say that it is true.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5733-0
00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:35.719
<v Westman, Claire>It's a true reflection of beauty,
or that I know beauty because that sunset</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5733-1
00:45:35.719 --> 00:45:37.299
<v Westman, Claire>no longer exists.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5736-0
00:45:37.989 --> 00:45:38.309
<v Westman, Claire>It's gone away.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5739-0
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.589
<v Westman, Claire>And also.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5748-0
00:45:41.539 --> 00:45:46.299
<v Westman, Claire>Because those are only my experiences of
beauty.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5754-0
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:49.029
<v Westman, Claire>Maybe you don't like sunset.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5775-0
00:45:49.029 --> 00:45:55.191
<v Westman, Claire>Maybe you have astigmatism or an eye
condition that makes you hated when it's</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5775-1
00:45:55.191 --> 00:45:58.509
<v Westman, Claire>bright outside, so you don't like sunsets.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5807-0
00:46:01.019 --> 00:46:07.099
<v Westman, Claire>So our perceptions of what is beautiful
might be different, but also again,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5807-1
00:46:07.099 --> 00:46:12.699
<v Westman, Claire>remember Plato says that if things are,
if they change or they decay,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5807-2
00:46:12.699 --> 00:46:14.779
<v Westman, Claire>or they fade, they cannot.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5817-0
00:46:16.749 --> 00:46:22.429
<v Westman, Claire>Be the real knowledge of that thing.
Because of those changes and decay.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5824-0
00:46:25.459 --> 00:46:27.899
<v Westman, Claire>OK, Joaquim, I see your hand is back up.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5834-0
00:46:37.179 --> 00:46:40.339
<v Westman, Claire>OK. Again, it looks like you're talking,
but I can't hear you.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5837-0
00:46:46.749 --> 00:46:48.109
<v Westman, Claire>OK. All right.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5845-0
00:46:49.499 --> 00:46:53.259
<v Westman, Claire>A Mac issue. Uh. Technology. OK,
you can ask.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5856-0
00:46:53.259 --> 00:46:55.202
<v Westman, Claire>Yeah,
you can put your question in the chat and</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5856-1
00:46:55.202 --> 00:46:56.579
<v Westman, Claire>I will come back to the questions.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5868-0
00:46:56.579 --> 00:46:59.799
<v Westman, Claire>It's just and I see there's quite a lot
of ideas going on,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5868-1
00:46:59.799 --> 00:47:01.219
<v Westman, Claire>so I'll come back to them.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5878-0
00:47:01.219 --> 00:47:05.219
<v Westman, Claire>They just just can't have the chat open,
otherwise I'm getting distracted.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5881-0
00:47:05.499 --> 00:47:07.179
<v Westman, Claire>Luyanda, do you have another question?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5885-0
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:10.069
<v Westman, Claire>Or is it a?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5887-0
00:47:10.179 --> 00:47:10.819
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>Yeah.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5889-0
00:47:12.819 --> 00:47:13.379
<v Westman, Claire>Yes.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5903-0
00:47:13.789 --> 00:47:19.269
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>So would you have an example of what
Plato thought was true knowledge?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5923-0
00:47:22.459 --> 00:47:27.506
<v Westman, Claire>Well, so for Plato,
true knowledge is working towards knowing</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5910-0
00:47:22.659 --> 00:47:23.619
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>Of something.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5923-1
00:47:27.506 --> 00:47:29.379
<v Westman, Claire>the form of that thing.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5940-0
00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:36.709
<v Westman, Claire>And now this is where it's tricky because
he doesn't really tell us what</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5940-1
00:47:36.709 --> 00:47:39.019
<v Westman, Claire>constitutes that thing.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5953-0
00:47:39.019 --> 00:47:44.924
<v Westman, Claire>So if he says that there's dogness,
we don't know exactly what constitutes</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5953-1
00:47:44.924 --> 00:47:46.499
<v Westman, Claire>the form of the dog.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5962-0
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:50.989
<v Westman, Claire>He says he kind of just expects that we
would.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5967-0
00:47:52.179 --> 00:47:54.499
<v Westman, Claire>That this dogness exists.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5976-0
00:47:55.989 --> 00:47:59.389
<v Westman, Claire>That could it be applied to all dogs and
that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5979-0
00:48:01.629 --> 00:48:02.189
<v Westman, Claire>He says that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/5992-0
00:48:04.029 --> 00:48:07.469
<v Westman, Claire>Particulars he puts it as particulars.
Participate in the form.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6011-0
00:48:09.189 --> 00:48:15.102
<v Westman, Claire>So if something is beautiful,
then the those particular instances</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6011-1
00:48:15.102 --> 00:48:18.149
<v Westman, Claire>participate in the form of beauty.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6018-0
00:48:18.149 --> 00:48:21.829
<v Westman, Claire>But he never really specifies what
exactly.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6025-0
00:48:22.139 --> 00:48:25.059
<v Westman, Claire>Exactly, beauty. What exactly?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6061-0
00:48:25.059 --> 00:48:30.094
<v Westman, Claire>The form of beauty would be he just says
that we have these forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6061-1
00:48:30.094 --> 00:48:34.153
<v Westman, Claire>Our soul knows our soul is up there with
those forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6061-2
00:48:34.153 --> 00:48:37.460
<v Westman, Claire>We can work towards knowledge of the
forms,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6061-3
00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.819
<v Westman, Claire>but we he doesn't really give us an idea
of what exactly.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6074-0
00:48:43.229 --> 00:48:49.229
<v Westman, Claire>Those forms are he just says that there's
a form that relates to everything.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6076-0
00:48:50.949 --> 00:48:51.069
<v Westman, Claire>But.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6094-0
00:48:52.019 --> 00:48:57.135
<v Westman, Claire>It is a bit tricky,
so this is kind of one of the one of the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6094-1
00:48:57.135 --> 00:48:59.819
<v Westman, Claire>sort of critiques against Plato.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6098-0
00:49:01.529 --> 00:49:02.849
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>OK, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6099-0
00:49:02.739 --> 00:49:03.179
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6100-0
00:49:02.849 --> 00:49:03.449
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>Thank you.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6102-0
00:49:04.949 --> 00:49:05.029
<v Westman, Claire>KJ.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6111-0
00:49:06.899 --> 00:49:11.019
<v Westman, Claire>OK, so that is a very that's a basic.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6137-0
00:49:12.469 --> 00:49:19.618
<v Westman, Claire>Idea of the Plato sort of hierarchy of
knowledge starting with imitations at the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6137-1
00:49:19.618 --> 00:49:23.149
<v Westman, Claire>bottom is the like. Very lowest kind of.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6140-0
00:49:26.899 --> 00:49:27.579
<v Westman, Claire>Sort of.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6155-0
00:49:27.579 --> 00:49:31.645
<v Westman, Claire>I don't want to say knowledge because
it's not a belief or opinion you can have</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6155-1
00:49:31.645 --> 00:49:32.459
<v Westman, Claire>about something.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6163-0
00:49:32.459 --> 00:49:38.139
<v Westman, Claire>Then there's the actual things that exist
but that are not true knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6173-0
00:49:38.139 --> 00:49:42.579
<v Westman, Claire>And we have our concepts which are from
our mind, which he thinks is.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6179-0
00:49:44.389 --> 00:49:45.869
<v Westman, Claire>You know more.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6188-0
00:49:45.869 --> 00:49:49.509
<v Westman, Claire>It was superior to material world,
but still not great.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6196-0
00:49:49.669 --> 00:49:53.429
<v Westman, Claire>And then we have the forms,
the world of the forms. OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6198-0
00:49:56.589 --> 00:49:56.789
<v Westman, Claire>So.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6200-0
00:49:56.869 --> 00:49:57.389
<v Westman, Claire>What so?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6205-0
00:49:58.279 --> 00:49:58.759
<v Westman, Claire>Hi, Todd.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6223-0
00:49:58.759 --> 00:50:03.049
<v Westman, Claire>It's the analogy of the cable,
the allegory of The Cave,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6223-1
00:50:03.049 --> 00:50:05.759
<v Westman, Claire>and he uses this to kind of explain.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6228-0
00:50:07.259 --> 00:50:10.059
<v Westman, Claire>The our pursuit of knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6262-0
00:50:10.679 --> 00:50:14.605
<v Westman, Claire>So again,
you don't necessarily have to go into</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6262-1
00:50:14.605 --> 00:50:18.778
<v Westman, Claire>this in detail in your question or in
your answer,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6262-2
00:50:18.778 --> 00:50:25.159
<v Westman, Claire>but just so that you have this idea,
you kind of see what he's talking about.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6274-0
00:50:26.149 --> 00:50:31.502
<v Westman, Claire>And let me just tell you,
there are so many videos and articles,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6274-1
00:50:31.502 --> 00:50:33.149
<v Westman, Claire>but a lot of videos.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6320-0
00:50:34.559 --> 00:50:39.316
<v Westman, Claire>Explaining the allegory of The Cave.
So if you're not getting all the stuff</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6320-1
00:50:39.316 --> 00:50:42.759
<v Westman, Claire>about the forms, remember,
and the allegory. Remember,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6320-2
00:50:42.759 --> 00:50:45.826
<v Westman, Claire>there are many,
many resources available to you,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6320-3
00:50:45.826 --> 00:50:50.959
<v Westman, Claire>and the way I explain something might not
be the way that you understand it best.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6320-4
00:50:50.959 --> 00:50:52.399
<v Westman, Claire>You might find another.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6332-0
00:50:52.399 --> 00:50:55.599
<v Westman, Claire>Person explains it in a way that you
understand better.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6351-0
00:50:56.509 --> 00:50:59.761
<v Westman, Claire>In the videos,
obviously there's more motion and there's,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6351-1
00:50:59.761 --> 00:51:02.509
<v Westman, Claire>you know,
different kinds of ways of explaining.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6374-0
00:51:02.509 --> 00:51:07.148
<v Westman, Claire>So if you're not getting it,
obviously ask me as well if you want to,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6374-1
00:51:07.148 --> 00:51:11.389
<v Westman, Claire>but always make sure you also just go
look for other resources.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6375-0
00:51:11.389 --> 00:51:12.429
<v Westman, Claire>So many.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6388-0
00:51:12.429 --> 00:51:15.918
<v Westman, Claire>Many, many,
many videos about the allegory of The</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6388-1
00:51:15.918 --> 00:51:18.709
<v Westman, Claire>Cave, so you can go watch those as well.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6398-0
00:51:20.319 --> 00:51:21.999
<v Westman, Claire>But basically what?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6401-0
00:51:21.999 --> 00:51:23.479
<v Westman, Claire>The allegory of The Cave says.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6411-0
00:51:23.479 --> 00:51:25.576
<v Westman, Claire>And again,
this is just going to be a very brief</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6411-1
00:51:25.576 --> 00:51:25.919
<v Westman, Claire>summary.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6435-0
00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:30.380
<v Westman, Claire>Of it is, Plato says,
that we must imagine that there are</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6435-1
00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:35.801
<v Westman, Claire>people who have been living in a cave,
so they've lived in a cave their whole</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6435-2
00:51:35.801 --> 00:51:36.149
<v Westman, Claire>life.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6447-0
00:51:36.149 --> 00:51:38.430
<v Westman, Claire>So this picture gives you a little bit
idea.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6447-1
00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:41.269
<v Westman, Claire>These people have lived in a cave for
their whole life.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6454-0
00:51:43.279 --> 00:51:44.279
<v Westman, Claire>You can see there.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6456-0
00:51:44.279 --> 00:51:46.639
<v Westman, Claire>Sorry, they've lived in The Cave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6471-0
00:51:48.359 --> 00:51:52.439
<v Westman, Claire>And there is ignore that that there's a
fire behind them.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6477-0
00:51:52.599 --> 00:51:56.599
<v Westman, Claire>So these people are here,
they they chained to a wall.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6479-0
00:51:57.069 --> 00:51:58.149
<v Westman, Claire>Inside The Cave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6484-0
00:51:59.639 --> 00:52:00.919
<v Westman, Claire>They have this fire behind them.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6490-0
00:52:02.639 --> 00:52:04.079
<v Westman, Claire>And then there are people walking.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6494-0
00:52:05.639 --> 00:52:06.839
<v Westman, Claire>In between them and the fire.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6507-0
00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:12.639
<v Westman, Claire>And they're holding different things.
So they're holding different objects.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6533-0
00:52:14.439 --> 00:52:19.923
<v Westman, Claire>And so the prisoners that are sitting
there facing the back of The Cave,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6533-1
00:52:19.923 --> 00:52:26.159
<v Westman, Claire>they will see here, which is particulars.
They will see these shadows on the wall.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6551-0
00:52:27.569 --> 00:52:30.688
<v Westman, Claire>So these people,
the people who walk past carrying these</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6551-1
00:52:30.688 --> 00:52:33.369
<v Westman, Claire>things,
maybe other animals actually do come in.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6566-0
00:52:33.369 --> 00:52:39.330
<v Westman, Claire>They walk in front of the fire and it
makes these reflections onto the back of</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6566-1
00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:40.009
<v Westman, Claire>the wall.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6575-0
00:52:40.449 --> 00:52:45.169
<v Westman, Claire>But now these prisoners have never been
outside of The Cave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6584-0
00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:49.569
<v Westman, Claire>So when they see these things and they
can't look behind them, they can.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6592-0
00:52:49.569 --> 00:52:53.303
<v Westman, Claire>There's only the wall behind them,
so they don't know there are these people</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6592-1
00:52:53.303 --> 00:52:54.079
<v Westman, Claire>carrying things.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6608-0
00:52:55.629 --> 00:53:00.989
<v Westman, Claire>So the reflections that they see on the
wall they think are real.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6618-0
00:53:01.149 --> 00:53:05.749
<v Westman, Claire>They think that is real knowledge of the
things that are behind them.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6628-0
00:53:06.509 --> 00:53:09.069
<v Westman, Claire>But now when we're looking at this,
we know, oh, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6656-0
00:53:09.069 --> 00:53:14.650
<v Westman, Claire>They're only just seeing these
reflections of the objects that are being</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6656-1
00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:19.696
<v Westman, Claire>carried by the people,
so the fire is illuminating these objects,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6656-2
00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:23.749
<v Westman, Claire>causing shadows on the wall of the back
of The Cave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6661-0
00:53:24.479 --> 00:53:25.439
<v Westman, Claire>And that's what the prisoners see.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6680-0
00:53:26.819 --> 00:53:30.360
<v Westman, Claire>But because that's all the prisoners have
experienced,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6680-1
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:33.579
<v Westman, Claire>that's all the perception they have of
the world.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6685-0
00:53:33.979 --> 00:53:36.779
<v Westman, Claire>They think that those things are real.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6701-0
00:53:37.869 --> 00:53:41.284
<v Westman, Claire>So we can see that they only have a
belief or an opinion.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6701-1
00:53:41.284 --> 00:53:43.109
<v Westman, Claire>They don't have real knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6717-0
00:53:44.599 --> 00:53:50.199
<v Westman, Claire>So Plato says that in this allegory that
the prisoners managed to get free.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6734-0
00:53:51.879 --> 00:53:56.359
<v Westman, Claire>And they realized that they can escape
The Cave, so they climb up.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6757-0
00:53:56.359 --> 00:54:01.617
<v Westman, Claire>They try and ascend to knowledge,
so they try to escape The Cave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6757-1
00:54:01.617 --> 00:54:06.239
<v Westman, Claire>They get out of The Cave and they the
world is so bright.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6759-0
00:54:06.239 --> 00:54:07.799
<v Westman, Claire>So now they've been stuck in this cave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6785-0
00:54:08.189 --> 00:54:12.208
<v Westman, Claire>Whatever the world is so bright,
it's so loud. Umm,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6785-1
00:54:12.208 --> 00:54:17.233
<v Westman, Claire>they're seeing actual animals,
so they're scared and they become</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6785-2
00:54:17.233 --> 00:54:20.789
<v Westman, Claire>overwhelmed in the world outside of The
Cave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6790-0
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:23.909
<v Westman, Claire>But this is what he says we should be
doing.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6795-0
00:54:23.909 --> 00:54:24.469
<v Westman, Claire>We are.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6801-0
00:54:24.469 --> 00:54:28.749
<v Westman, Claire>We should unshackle ourselves from this
cave, which is.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6811-0
00:54:30.599 --> 00:54:32.919
<v Westman, Claire>Our material world and our sensory
experiences.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6819-0
00:54:33.079 --> 00:54:37.559
<v Westman, Claire>And we should try to ascend out of The
Cave towards the realm.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6824-0
00:54:37.989 --> 00:54:40.469
<v Westman, Claire>Of the forms, which is true knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6827-0
00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:42.479
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6847-0
00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:46.678
<v Westman, Claire>But if we're thinking of these prisoners,
they come out of The Cave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6847-1
00:54:46.678 --> 00:54:49.599
<v Westman, Claire>Some of the prisoners find it too
overwhelming.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6852-0
00:54:49.639 --> 00:54:51.999
<v Westman, Claire>So they go back into The Cave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6878-0
00:54:53.549 --> 00:54:58.012
<v Westman, Claire>But when they go back into The Cave,
the prisoners that were kept there think</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6878-1
00:54:58.012 --> 00:55:02.189
<v Westman, Claire>that they are lying because now they've
never experienced anything else.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6910-0
00:55:02.189 --> 00:55:07.541
<v Westman, Claire>So they think that these prisoners who
have been out of The Cave and come back</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6910-1
00:55:07.541 --> 00:55:12.960
<v Westman, Claire>and tell them about their experiences,
they don't believe that they are telling</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6910-2
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.499
<v Westman, Claire>the truth. But in any case,
let's say one prisoner makes it out of</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6910-3
00:55:17.499 --> 00:55:18.109
<v Westman, Claire>The Cave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6920-0
00:55:18.839 --> 00:55:21.359
<v Westman, Claire>And he doesn't become he or she.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6922-0
00:55:21.359 --> 00:55:22.919
<v Westman, Claire>They don't become too overwhelmed.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6937-0
00:55:23.389 --> 00:55:29.337
<v Westman, Claire>Films by being out in the world beyond
The Cave, then they start to see, oh,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6937-1
00:55:29.337 --> 00:55:31.269
<v Westman, Claire>there's a there's a tree.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6942-0
00:55:32.719 --> 00:55:33.679
<v Westman, Claire>There's an actual horse.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6950-0
00:55:35.319 --> 00:55:36.799
<v Westman, Claire>There's an, you know, there's water.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6976-0
00:55:37.079 --> 00:55:43.338
<v Westman, Claire>So they realize that those things that
they were seeing in The Cave were only</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6976-1
00:55:43.338 --> 00:55:49.759
<v Westman, Claire>shadows or reflections of these things
that exist in the world beyond The Cave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6981-0
00:55:49.839 --> 00:55:53.159
<v Westman, Claire>So Plato is using this as a way for us to.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6996-0
00:55:53.469 --> 00:55:59.772
<v Westman, Claire>Think about our minds and our experiences
and our and the different levels of</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/6996-1
00:55:59.772 --> 00:56:01.389
<v Westman, Claire>knowledge and truth.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7040-0
00:56:02.919 --> 00:56:08.585
<v Westman, Claire>So he says that if we get stuck in our
bodies, in our experiences,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7040-1
00:56:08.585 --> 00:56:15.520
<v Westman, Claire>we can be fooled into thinking that the
things that we perceive or experience are</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7040-2
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:19.410
<v Westman, Claire>real. However,
once we know once we have this</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7040-3
00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:23.639
<v Westman, Claire>understanding that what we experience
isn't true.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7057-0
00:56:23.989 --> 00:56:31.229
<v Westman, Claire>Through or isn't real knowledge we can
work our way up towards gaining knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7077-0
00:56:31.229 --> 00:56:35.762
<v Westman, Claire>We work our way up by using reason and
rationality,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7077-1
00:56:35.762 --> 00:56:42.389
<v Westman, Claire>and we try and ascend towards the realm
of the forms we unburden ourselves.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7079-0
00:56:43.799 --> 00:56:43.879
<v Westman, Claire>Of.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7106-0
00:56:44.629 --> 00:56:49.868
<v Westman, Claire>Relying on sensory experience,
we start to use our reason and</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7106-1
00:56:49.868 --> 00:56:56.543
<v Westman, Claire>rationality and prioritise reason and
rationality in order to work towards the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7106-2
00:56:56.543 --> 00:56:58.149
<v Westman, Claire>realm of the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7118-0
00:56:59.639 --> 00:57:02.879
<v Westman, Claire>And in this realm of the forms,
we can see that the.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7132-0
00:57:05.919 --> 00:57:10.779
<v Westman, Claire>Sun is it illuminates everything. OK,
so in the world,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7132-1
00:57:10.779 --> 00:57:13.519
<v Westman, Claire>the sun illuminates everything.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7144-0
00:57:13.949 --> 00:57:17.149
<v Westman, Claire>The sun,
once the prisoner gets out of The Cave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7169-0
00:57:17.189 --> 00:57:23.212
<v Westman, Claire>The sun illuminates the world now that
he's in so because of the light from the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7169-1
00:57:23.212 --> 00:57:28.709
<v Westman, Claire>sun, he's able to experience the trees,
the horse, the water, the grass.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7186-0
00:57:28.749 --> 00:57:35.545
<v Westman, Claire>He's able to experience the world and we
will see now that for Plato,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7186-1
00:57:35.545 --> 00:57:40.109
<v Westman, Claire>the Sun is an analogy of the form of the
good.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7188-0
00:57:41.669 --> 00:57:42.189
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7229-0
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:48.548
<v Westman, Claire>So try and think of it like that if it
helps you. We're shackled here, he says.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7229-1
00:57:48.548 --> 00:57:51.900
<v Westman, Claire>In our material world,
we experience things.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7229-2
00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:57.860
<v Westman, Claire>We have these perceptions that fools us
into thinking that these things that we</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7229-3
00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:00.989
<v Westman, Claire>can experience and perceive our knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7236-0
00:58:01.029 --> 00:58:03.029
<v Westman, Claire>But he says that's not true knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7240-0
00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:05.909
<v Westman, Claire>Those are reflections or particular
objects.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7249-0
00:58:06.719 --> 00:58:09.199
<v Westman, Claire>So he says that we need to then use
reason.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7259-0
00:58:10.879 --> 00:58:13.039
<v Westman, Claire>And rationality,
we need to try and ascend.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7269-0
00:58:13.429 --> 00:58:17.349
<v Westman, Claire>Towards actual knowledge,
which is the realm of the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7280-0
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:22.349
<v Westman, Claire>So we try and come out of The Cave to the
realm of the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7296-0
00:58:22.349 --> 00:58:29.443
<v Westman, Claire>We try and free ourselves from being
burdened by only thinking we know through</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7296-1
00:58:29.443 --> 00:58:31.509
<v Westman, Claire>our sensory experience.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7305-0
00:58:31.509 --> 00:58:36.909
<v Westman, Claire>So we go from what he says is illusion to
truth, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7315-0
00:58:38.399 --> 00:58:40.319
<v Westman, Claire>So then that brings us to the form of the
good.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7320-0
00:58:40.359 --> 00:58:43.439
<v Westman, Claire>So,
like the sun in the allegory of The Cave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7345-0
00:58:44.229 --> 00:58:51.819
<v Westman, Claire>If all illuminates the world and allows
us to see or experience things in the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7345-1
00:58:51.819 --> 00:58:56.101
<v Westman, Claire>world,
the form of the good illuminates all</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7345-2
00:58:56.101 --> 00:58:57.269
<v Westman, Claire>other forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7351-0
00:58:57.509 --> 00:59:00.989
<v Westman, Claire>So for Plato, the form of the good.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7361-0
00:59:02.439 --> 00:59:03.919
<v Westman, Claire>Is the most superior.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7377-0
00:59:03.919 --> 00:59:10.319
<v Westman, Claire>It's the highest form of all the forms,
so he says in our pursuit of seeking the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7377-1
00:59:10.319 --> 00:59:13.559
<v Westman, Claire>form of the good. That is how we come to.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7402-0
00:59:13.949 --> 00:59:18.899
<v Westman, Claire>Attain knowledge of the other forms.
So without the form of the good we cannot</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7402-1
00:59:18.899 --> 00:59:23.349
<v Westman, Claire>get knowledge of the form of justice,
the form of beauty, the form of.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7437-0
00:59:24.919 --> 00:59:28.869
<v Westman, Claire>Anything.
So we need to we need to pursue knowledge</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7437-1
00:59:28.869 --> 00:59:34.870
<v Westman, Claire>of the form of the good in order to gain
knowledge and truth of other forms of</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7437-2
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:41.099
<v Westman, Claire>other things in order to gain knowledge
we have to try and pursue the form of the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7437-3
00:59:41.099 --> 00:59:41.479
<v Westman, Claire>good.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7453-0
00:59:43.279 --> 00:59:47.839
<v Westman, Claire>So our lives are directed to finding
knowledge of the highest good.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7461-0
00:59:47.839 --> 00:59:51.639
<v Westman, Claire>So it's like a light that guides our
souls or our minds.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7482-0
00:59:54.079 --> 00:59:57.392
<v Westman, Claire>So like in The Cave,
we're trying to get rid of our shackles.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7482-1
00:59:57.392 --> 01:00:00.599
<v Westman, Claire>That chain us to the wall and keep us
confined to The Cave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7499-0
01:00:02.319 --> 01:00:07.599
<v Westman, Claire>Plato thinks that in pursuit of knowledge
of the highest good, we are unshackled.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7515-0
01:00:07.599 --> 01:00:11.770
<v Westman, Claire>Or we overcome our mortal or physical
limitations and our imperfect sense</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7515-1
01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:14.588
<v Westman, Claire>perceptions,
which are our opinions or beliefs or</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7515-2
01:00:14.588 --> 01:00:15.039
<v Westman, Claire>beliefs.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7525-0
01:00:15.879 --> 01:00:20.559
<v Westman, Claire>And we are able to then work towards
knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7538-0
01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:27.229
<v Westman, Claire>So he says that in that pursuit of
working towards knowledge of the good.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7550-0
01:00:28.499 --> 01:00:35.499
<v Westman, Claire>We are able to attain knowledge of
justice of all these other things.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7559-0
01:00:36.909 --> 01:00:38.509
<v Westman, Claire>And it does explain this in your study
guide.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7564-0
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:42.269
<v Westman, Claire>But we are able to work towards.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7574-0
01:00:43.949 --> 01:00:47.389
<v Westman, Claire>That knowledge of these other things,
and it is that pursuit of the good.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7593-0
01:00:49.469 --> 01:00:56.729
<v Westman, Claire>That helps us to live a virtuous life.
So to live a virtuous life or to find</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7593-1
01:00:56.729 --> 01:00:57.389
<v Westman, Claire>virtue.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7610-0
01:00:58.059 --> 01:01:03.496
<v Westman, Claire>We must be in pursuit of the knowledge of
the good, and for Plato,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7610-1
01:01:03.496 --> 01:01:06.499
<v Westman, Claire>virtue is not just the way we behave.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7644-0
01:01:06.499 --> 01:01:12.865
<v Westman, Claire>It's not just our external behaviours,
it's a state of being and it's the state</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7644-1
01:01:12.865 --> 01:01:19.073
<v Westman, Claire>of being in which you are pursuing the
knowledge of the form of the good. OK,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7644-2
01:01:19.073 --> 01:01:21.699
<v Westman, Claire>so he says if we put our efforts.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7652-0
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:26.589
<v Westman, Claire>Into trying to know the form of the good.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7680-0
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:34.526
<v Westman, Claire>We will then live a life that is just and
ethical and we will live in moderation</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7680-1
01:01:34.526 --> 01:01:40.109
<v Westman, Claire>and those are attributes that help us to
live a virtuous life.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7701-0
01:01:41.629 --> 01:01:46.069
<v Westman, Claire>And it is those attributes that help us
to work towards knowledge of the good.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7702-0
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:47.709
<v Westman, Claire>So it's letting go of.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7718-0
01:01:51.419 --> 01:01:58.099
<v Westman, Claire>Our appetites which so I don't want to
get into too much, but Plato says.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7733-0
01:01:59.589 --> 01:02:01.893
<v Westman, Claire>Our material world or our sense
experiences,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7733-1
01:02:01.893 --> 01:02:03.429
<v Westman, Claire>they are tied to our appetite.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7750-0
01:02:03.429 --> 01:02:09.748
<v Westman, Claire>So he wants us to let go of these
material experiences or let go of</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7750-1
01:02:09.748 --> 01:02:12.629
<v Westman, Claire>prioritizing material expenses.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7755-0
01:02:14.349 --> 01:02:16.509
<v Westman, Claire>Experiences, not expenses and.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7761-0
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:19.949
<v Westman, Claire>Focus more on rationality.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7777-0
01:02:20.379 --> 01:02:26.921
<v Westman, Claire>Reason and that involves moderation.
Thinking about justice,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7777-1
01:02:26.921 --> 01:02:30.139
<v Westman, Claire>thinking about ethical living.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7787-0
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:32.469
<v Westman, Claire>Thinking about courage.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7821-0
01:02:32.469 --> 01:02:37.109
<v Westman, Claire>So there's various specific attributes
that Plato mentioned,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7821-1
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:43.119
<v Westman, Claire>but using our reason and rationality and
working towards knowledge of the good</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7821-2
01:02:43.119 --> 01:02:48.749
<v Westman, Claire>allows us to understand or have knowledge
of these other attributes that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7826-0
01:02:51.149 --> 01:02:51.829
<v Westman, Claire>Help us to.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7833-0
01:02:52.339 --> 01:02:55.179
<v Westman, Claire>Laugh. OK, luyanda.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7867-0
01:03:01.979 --> 01:03:06.979
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>So when we answer the question,
are we answering the question from the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7844-0
01:03:04.879 --> 01:03:05.399
<v Westman, Claire>Yes.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7867-1
01:03:06.979 --> 01:03:12.684
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>perspective of the definition of virtue
during the Greek times or the modern day</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7867-2
01:03:12.684 --> 01:03:13.459
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>definition?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7893-0
01:03:13.699 --> 01:03:18.516
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>'Cause I think I'm getting confused as
well because the way you're explaining it,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7893-1
01:03:18.516 --> 01:03:22.745
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>you're making it sound like we're
answering based off of the modern day</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7893-2
01:03:22.745 --> 01:03:23.979
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>definition of virtue.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7900-0
01:03:30.179 --> 01:03:32.739
<v Westman, Claire>So I'm just trying to think here.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7914-0
01:03:34.869 --> 01:03:40.229
<v Westman, Claire>Remember, you need to think about what,
what Plato would consider a good life.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7921-0
01:03:40.229 --> 01:03:42.789
<v Westman, Claire>So there's things like moderation,
courage.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7930-0
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:47.368
<v Westman, Claire>Rationality.
So those are things that make a virtuous</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7930-1
01:03:47.368 --> 01:03:47.629
<v Westman, Claire>life.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7951-0
01:03:49.389 --> 01:03:53.329
<v Westman, Claire>Not necessarily.
Things that we might think of as virtue,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7951-1
01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:57.949
<v Westman, Claire>as like philanthropy, you know,
helping others, that kind of thing.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7970-0
01:03:58.499 --> 01:04:03.616
<v Westman, Claire>So when you're answering,
you need to type into what Plato would</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7970-1
01:04:03.616 --> 01:04:05.899
<v Westman, Claire>consider a virtuous life, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7972-0
01:04:05.899 --> 01:04:08.379
<v Westman, Claire>So in the study guide.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/7980-0
01:04:09.909 --> 01:04:11.749
<v Westman, Claire>This is something I wanted to mention as
well.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8008-0
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:16.085
<v Westman, Claire>You need to look also at Plato's ideas of
ethics,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8008-1
01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:22.273
<v Westman, Claire>which are on pages 82 to around 84,
and that gives you a better idea of</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8008-2
01:04:22.273 --> 01:04:27.429
<v Westman, Claire>specifically what Plato thinks of
morality, virtue, ethics.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8019-0
01:04:27.699 --> 01:04:32.739
<v Westman, Claire>6 and so you need to then think about how
that ties into.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8027-0
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:38.589
<v Westman, Claire>The form of the good and working towards
knowledge of the form of the good.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8029-0
01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:43.019
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8032-0
01:04:43.329 --> 01:04:43.569
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8059-0
01:04:43.729 --> 01:04:47.372
<v Westman, Claire>So yeah,
so just go look at pages 82 to 84 as well.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8059-1
01:04:47.372 --> 01:04:52.486
<v Westman, Claire>And obviously when you're answering
because the question is specifically</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8059-2
01:04:52.486 --> 01:04:55.849
<v Westman, Claire>about what does Plato,
how could we understand?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8064-0
01:04:59.519 --> 01:05:01.719
<v Westman, Claire>Why did virtue depend on knowledge?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8083-0
01:05:03.669 --> 01:05:10.949
<v Westman, Claire>You must go look at what Plato's ideas of
morality, ethics, and goodness entail, OK?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8085-0
01:05:13.459 --> 01:05:14.019
<v Westman, Claire>Correct.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8087-0
01:05:14.779 --> 01:05:14.939
<v Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8092-0
01:05:15.739 --> 01:05:16.299
<v Westman, Claire>Oh, sorry. OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8100-0
01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:20.459
<v Westman, Claire>So that's what I wanted to cover with you
today again.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8119-0
01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:23.354
<v Westman, Claire>I know we're not going into a lot of
detail,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8119-1
01:05:23.354 --> 01:05:26.379
<v Westman, Claire>but I also know this can be very
overwhelming.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8132-0
01:05:26.379 --> 01:05:30.819
<v Westman, Claire>So some of you have a good underst or
have an understanding of this already.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8146-0
01:05:30.979 --> 01:05:36.319
<v Westman, Claire>I know you have questions that are more
specific about the forms,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8146-1
01:05:36.319 --> 01:05:38.099
<v Westman, Claire>about ideas of virtue.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8152-0
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:44.149
<v Westman, Claire>So, as Joaquim asked as well.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8179-0
01:05:44.579 --> 01:05:49.429
<v Westman, Claire>Well,
but I don't want it to become too complex</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8179-1
01:05:49.429 --> 01:05:57.412
<v Westman, Claire>at this stage because I know this is very
overwhelming for most people at this</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8179-2
01:05:57.412 --> 01:05:58.019
<v Westman, Claire>point.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8187-0
01:05:58.019 --> 01:06:01.299
<v Westman, Claire>Most students at this point or for a lot
of students at this point.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8192-0
01:06:03.469 --> 01:06:04.629
<v Westman, Claire>So if you are.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8214-0
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:10.779
<v Westman, Claire>If you already have an understanding
which I can see that some of you do,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8214-1
01:06:10.779 --> 01:06:15.189
<v Westman, Claire>then you are able you you can go look at
making a more complex argument.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8226-0
01:06:16.099 --> 01:06:20.539
<v Westman, Claire>But for everybody else right now,
I just have tried to keep it.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8230-0
01:06:21.819 --> 01:06:23.019
<v Westman, Claire>Sort of to the basic.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8240-0
01:06:24.989 --> 01:06:27.789
<v Westman, Claire>Or fundamental sort of ideas that you
need.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8245-0
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:31.549
<v Westman, Claire>For this question, OK, so.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8264-0
01:06:33.669 --> 01:06:37.672
<v Westman, Claire>Yeah, I'm sorry.
We're not getting into more specific</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8264-1
01:06:37.672 --> 01:06:42.269
<v Westman, Claire>details for those of you who have some
understanding already.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8286-0
01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:48.331
<v Westman, Claire>I just know that a lot of people have
sort of struggled with the assignment and</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8286-1
01:06:48.331 --> 01:06:51.789
<v Westman, Claire>are already feeling a bit overwhelmed and
out of their depth.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8293-0
01:06:52.219 --> 01:06:54.459
<v Westman, Claire>So I don't wanna ask.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8302-0
01:06:56.389 --> 01:06:58.949
<v Westman, Claire>I don't wanna go into too much detail yet.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8305-0
01:06:58.949 --> 01:06:59.019
<v Westman, Claire>I know, I said.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8344-0
01:06:59.019 --> 01:07:04.105
<v Westman, Claire>We chat about Parmenides soon,
but again for this for the last two</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8344-1
01:07:04.105 --> 01:07:09.647
<v Westman, Claire>sessions I only want to focus on the
three questions for your assignment</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8344-2
01:07:09.647 --> 01:07:14.734
<v Westman, Claire>because it's due tomorrow.
You don't need to discuss Parmenides in</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8344-3
01:07:14.734 --> 01:07:19.669
<v Westman, Claire>your answers for the questions,
so we are going to keep that we.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8349-0
01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:21.269
<v Westman, Claire>Can look at that next week.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8353-0
01:07:22.299 --> 01:07:23.379
<v Westman, Claire>We can go back.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8386-0
01:07:25.269 --> 01:07:30.826
<v Westman, Claire>To sort of looking at Unit 1 in more
detail and going into that in more detail</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8386-1
01:07:30.826 --> 01:07:34.344
<v Westman, Claire>then, OK,
so some of the things you might want to</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8386-2
01:07:34.344 --> 01:07:39.269
<v Westman, Claire>think about or do you think there is a
realm of ideal forms of these?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8396-0
01:07:41.189 --> 01:07:46.269
<v Westman, Claire>This realm of perfect,
unchanging universal forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8408-0
01:07:47.769 --> 01:07:51.329
<v Westman, Claire>Do you think I'm under separate from my
body or do you think we have a soul?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8432-0
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:59.453
<v Westman, Claire>That is separate from our bodies and this
is a very big topic in philosophy.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8432-1
01:07:59.453 --> 01:08:02.309
<v Westman, Claire>The idea of dualism, materialism.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8445-0
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:06.069
<v Westman, Claire>So dualism is where you think you've got
a soul that's separate from your body.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8446-0
01:08:06.149 --> 01:08:08.709
<v Westman, Claire>Materialism says that your soul.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8448-0
01:08:10.349 --> 01:08:10.669
<v Westman, Claire>Is your brain.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8452-0
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:13.229
<v Westman, Claire>That your soul is just.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8466-0
01:08:14.869 --> 01:08:16.989
<v Westman, Claire>Well, virtual,
they say that your mind is your soul,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8466-1
01:08:16.989 --> 01:08:18.309
<v Westman, Claire>but your mind is just a material.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8473-0
01:08:18.819 --> 01:08:20.779
<v Westman, Claire>Aspect as well.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8477-0
01:08:20.939 --> 01:08:22.779
<v Westman, Claire>So what do you think?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8489-0
01:08:22.779 --> 01:08:25.405
<v Westman, Claire>And we're not gonna get into all of this
now because again,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8489-1
01:08:25.405 --> 01:08:28.819
<v Westman, Claire>this was supposed to be a short lesson,
and we almost had an hour and a half.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8510-0
01:08:30.629 --> 01:08:35.695
<v Westman, Claire>Do we need to seek knowledge of the good
in order to live virtuously? And here,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8510-1
01:08:35.695 --> 01:08:37.469
<v Westman, Claire>what do you think of virtue?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8520-0
01:08:37.469 --> 01:08:40.109
<v Westman, Claire>Might not be exactly what Plato thinks of
his virtue.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8527-0
01:08:40.109 --> 01:08:43.549
<v Westman, Claire>So go and just check that as well for
yourselves.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8534-0
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:47.549
<v Westman, Claire>So do you agree with the idea of the
forms or not?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8536-0
01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:48.099
<v Westman, Claire>Out.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8546-0
01:08:48.899 --> 01:08:53.619
<v Westman, Claire>And then think about objections to
Plato's arguments, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8587-0
01:08:55.669 --> 01:09:00.658
<v Westman, Claire>So there are some in the study guide,
but obviously you can go and look for</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8587-1
01:09:00.658 --> 01:09:05.909
<v Westman, Claire>more as well in your own research. OK,
I'm going to quickly look at some of the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8587-2
01:09:05.909 --> 01:09:09.651
<v Westman, Claire>chat, see if there's anything,
any answer straight away.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8587-3
01:09:09.651 --> 01:09:11.949
<v Westman, Claire>But I see there's a lot of discuss.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8596-0
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:14.429
<v Westman, Claire>So I don't know if I'll go through all of
it.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8600-0
01:09:17.979 --> 01:09:18.579
<v Westman, Claire>Sure. OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8607-0
01:09:19.099 --> 01:09:20.739
<v Westman, Claire>Yeah, there's a lot of chat here.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8613-0
01:09:21.139 --> 01:09:23.619
<v Westman, Claire>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, yes.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8627-0
01:09:27.539 --> 01:09:30.259
<v Westman, Claire>OK.
Sounds like you're saying that we can</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8627-1
01:09:30.259 --> 01:09:31.619
<v Westman, Claire>know what a horse is.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8643-0
01:09:32.179 --> 01:09:36.636
<v Westman, Claire>Armchair reflection because there's this
perfect form of a horse that exists that</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8643-1
01:09:36.636 --> 01:09:38.539
<v Westman, Claire>we can recollect from our time. OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8650-0
01:09:41.539 --> 01:09:43.379
<v Westman, Claire>It doesn't make sense to you.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8656-0
01:09:43.659 --> 01:09:46.739
<v Westman, Claire>Perfectly acceptable if it doesn't make
sense to you.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8667-0
01:09:49.459 --> 01:09:53.179
<v Westman, Claire>I'll be honest,
I'm not entirely sold on the idea of.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8671-0
01:09:55.629 --> 01:09:56.269
<v Westman, Claire>Plato's ideas either.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8707-0
01:09:58.029 --> 01:10:00.367
<v Westman, Claire>If the soul is superior to the material
body,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8707-1
01:10:00.367 --> 01:10:04.534
<v Westman, Claire>wouldn't that mean that the things that
the soul knows or experienced is going to</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8707-2
01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:06.669
<v Westman, Claire>make the material body experience deja vu?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8716-0
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:10.669
<v Westman, Claire>Because, well,
that's kind of what you say.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8721-0
01:10:10.749 --> 01:10:13.589
<v Westman, Claire>Almost like a deja vu.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8728-0
01:10:13.989 --> 01:10:18.103
<v Westman, Claire>And again,
this is getting into much more specific</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8728-1
01:10:18.103 --> 01:10:18.749
<v Westman, Claire>complex.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8750-0
01:10:19.099 --> 01:10:24.501
<v Westman, Claire>Topics I don't want to go there just yet,
but things about like a priori knowledge</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8750-1
01:10:24.501 --> 01:10:26.259
<v Westman, Claire>and a posteriori knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8772-0
01:10:26.259 --> 01:10:33.578
<v Westman, Claire>So the idea that we have this knowledge
already imply kind of implanted in US or</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8772-1
01:10:33.578 --> 01:10:38.819
<v Westman, Claire>available to us when we're born or when
we come to exist.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8782-0
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:42.869
<v Westman, Claire>So yeah, that's it's a.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8791-0
01:10:43.349 --> 01:10:50.349
<v Westman, Claire>It becomes a very complex concept and
it's a a very big topic.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8806-0
01:10:51.779 --> 01:10:54.493
<v Westman, Claire>In philosophy,
especially philosophy of mind,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8806-1
01:10:54.493 --> 01:10:55.379
<v Westman, Claire>like how do we?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8814-0
01:10:55.379 --> 01:10:59.699
<v Westman, Claire>How can we have knowledge that is already
exists?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8831-0
01:11:01.459 --> 01:11:05.834
<v Westman, Claire>So some philosophers, for example,
believe that we don't have knowledge</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8831-1
01:11:05.834 --> 01:11:07.779
<v Westman, Claire>exactly, but we have structures.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8845-0
01:11:10.089 --> 01:11:15.929
<v Westman, Claire>Into which we can categorize information
that already exists when we are born.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8869-0
01:11:16.209 --> 01:11:20.197
<v Westman, Claire>So it becomes very tricky,
but I'm very excited to see a lot of you</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8869-1
01:11:20.197 --> 01:11:24.831
<v Westman, Claire>thinking about these things already and
sort of coming up with these questions</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8869-2
01:11:24.831 --> 01:11:26.649
<v Westman, Claire>and coming up with these ideas.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8880-0
01:11:32.969 --> 01:11:35.580
<v Westman, Claire>If something happens,
you get a weird feeling.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8880-1
01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.969
<v Westman, Claire>It's happened before, OK?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8889-0
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:44.749
<v Westman, Claire>OK,
some of these are just replying to others.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8895-0
01:11:47.819 --> 01:11:49.739
<v Westman, Claire>My brain hurts, yes.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8897-0
01:11:49.329 --> 01:11:51.729
<v Allison Megan McAllister>Lectures. Lectures.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8906-0
01:11:57.109 --> 01:11:59.523
<v Westman, Claire>Allison,
is that a question or have you put your</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8906-1
01:11:59.523 --> 01:12:00.509
<v Westman, Claire>mark on by accident?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8909-0
01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:04.559
<v Allison Megan McAllister>Put it on by accident.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8919-0
01:12:04.959 --> 01:12:09.799
<v Westman, Claire>OK, something like the world we see here,
smile, etc.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8924-0
01:12:09.799 --> 01:12:11.959
<v Westman, Claire>Is the one that isn't real, yes.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8951-0
01:12:13.819 --> 01:12:17.378
<v Westman, Claire>OK, we see here, smell etcetera.
Is the one that isn't real because</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8951-1
01:12:17.378 --> 01:12:21.095
<v Westman, Claire>there's no perfect and unchanging
instance of a particular thing. Yes,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8951-2
01:12:21.095 --> 01:12:21.619
<v Westman, Claire>that's it.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8953-0
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.229
<v Westman, Claire>Uh.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8960-0
01:12:30.599 --> 01:12:33.439
<v Westman, Claire>OK, something about Jaden Smith.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8977-0
01:12:36.259 --> 01:12:40.979
<v Westman, Claire>I'm enjoying these comics, but yeah,
I'm not gonna read out them all out loud.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8980-0
01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:43.019
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/8985-0
01:12:43.019 --> 01:12:47.699
<v Westman, Claire>Some turn to religion.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9004-0
01:12:51.939 --> 01:12:55.683
<v Westman, Claire>There's one comment here that philosophy
wasn't in favour of God because it</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9004-1
01:12:55.683 --> 01:12:56.619
<v Westman, Claire>believes in reason.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9022-0
01:12:56.939 --> 01:13:04.165
<v Westman, Claire>There's a whole branch of philosophy
related to philosophy of religion,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9022-1
01:13:04.165 --> 01:13:07.979
<v Westman, Claire>and for example, later in this module.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9037-0
01:13:09.539 --> 01:13:14.685
<v Westman, Claire>You will deal with some of some
philosophers arguments for the existence</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9037-1
01:13:14.685 --> 01:13:15.179
<v Westman, Claire>of God.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9049-0
01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:20.259
<v Westman, Claire>And some of them,
some of them use ideas around logic.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9061-0
01:13:21.209 --> 01:13:24.809
<v Westman, Claire>And reason in order to argue for God.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9066-0
01:13:25.009 --> 01:13:29.769
<v Westman, Claire>So philosophy is certainly not dismissive
of religion.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9084-0
01:13:31.419 --> 01:13:38.699
<v Westman, Claire>A lot of philosophy actually entails
religion or a belief in God.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9089-0
01:13:38.939 --> 01:13:42.419
<v Westman, Claire>So you will get.
You will get to see that a bit later on.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9092-0
01:13:45.339 --> 01:13:45.739
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9101-0
01:13:45.739 --> 01:13:50.939
<v Westman, Claire>Proof of the existence of God. Yes,
we will look at Aquinas and and some.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9103-0
01:13:55.079 --> 01:13:56.159
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9107-0
01:13:59.619 --> 01:14:00.019
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9116-0
01:14:00.019 --> 01:14:02.739
<v Westman, Claire>Yeah, sorry.
I'm just trying to get through these.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9120-0
01:14:02.739 --> 01:14:04.459
<v Westman, Claire>Plato was very vague, yeah.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9123-0
01:14:07.099 --> 01:14:07.699
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9139-0
01:14:08.539 --> 01:14:12.085
<v Westman, Claire>I mean, yeah,
there's some really interesting things</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9139-1
01:14:12.085 --> 01:14:15.699
<v Westman, Claire>here that I'm not going to get into all
of these now.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9163-0
01:14:19.959 --> 01:14:22.483
<v Westman, Claire>Yeah.
And we will look more specifically at</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9163-1
01:14:22.483 --> 01:14:26.900
<v Westman, Claire>interpretations of God and religion and
ideas about that when we get to that</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9163-2
01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:27.359
<v Westman, Claire>section.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9168-0
01:14:27.359 --> 01:14:29.799
<v Westman, Claire>So we're not going to look at that now.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9175-0
01:14:34.519 --> 01:14:36.279
<v Westman, Claire>Yes. So somebody says.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9217-0
01:14:36.279 --> 01:14:40.505
<v Westman, Claire>So this is quite relevant if the spirit
far surpasses the material body.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9217-1
01:14:40.505 --> 01:14:43.922
<v Westman, Claire>There's a spiritual world,
meaning that there are spirits.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9217-2
01:14:43.922 --> 01:14:47.917
<v Westman, Claire>Doesn't that mean this is not the first
body my spirit has lived in,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9217-3
01:14:47.917 --> 01:14:50.464
<v Westman, Claire>but is another embodiment which will
decay,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9217-4
01:14:50.464 --> 01:14:52.549
<v Westman, Claire>allowing it to return from where it.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9223-0
01:14:52.539 --> 01:14:54.159
<v Westman, Claire>Came and coming back as a different
person.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9231-0
01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:58.479
<v Westman, Claire>So this is kind of something that Plato
says, he says that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9239-0
01:14:59.419 --> 01:15:00.779
<v Westman, Claire>The soul will.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9244-0
01:15:00.939 --> 01:15:03.019
<v Westman, Claire>The soul is in the realm of the forms.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9269-0
01:15:04.529 --> 01:15:09.102
<v Westman, Claire>But when we die,
our soul might return to the forms,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9269-1
01:15:09.102 --> 01:15:12.209
<v Westman, Claire>but then it can come back to a body.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9281-0
01:15:12.209 --> 01:15:18.769
<v Westman, Claire>So again there we're getting into like a
little bit of realm of like reincarnation.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9291-0
01:15:20.219 --> 01:15:22.579
<v Westman, Claire>But you can have a look at that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9318-0
01:15:22.579 --> 01:15:25.912
<v Westman, Claire>There is a small discussion about that in
the study guide,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9318-1
01:15:25.912 --> 01:15:29.246
<v Westman, Claire>so I won't go into it now because we are
really over time,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9318-2
01:15:29.246 --> 01:15:33.202
<v Westman, Claire>but very interesting point.
You can go read that and maybe do some of</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9318-3
01:15:33.202 --> 01:15:34.219
<v Westman, Claire>your own research.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9324-0
01:15:34.529 --> 01:15:36.369
<v Westman, Claire>Urgency. What do you think about that?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9341-0
01:15:41.239 --> 01:15:44.556
<v Westman, Claire>If you haven't tapped into something you
don't have the raw sensory understanding</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9341-1
01:15:44.556 --> 01:15:44.799
<v Westman, Claire>of it.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9346-0
01:15:44.799 --> 01:15:48.319
<v Westman, Claire>So how's it any form of sensory
experience?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9348-0
01:15:52.059 --> 01:15:52.579
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9356-0
01:15:56.769 --> 01:15:59.929
<v Westman, Claire>OK, alright. Yeah,
let me quickly go through these.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9366-0
01:16:04.429 --> 01:16:06.509
<v Westman, Claire>Somebody use computer crashed.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9368-0
01:16:06.509 --> 01:16:08.189
<v Westman, Claire>Please e-mail me directly.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9376-0
01:16:25.489 --> 01:16:28.049
<v Westman, Claire>A lot of chechia.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9386-0
01:16:29.209 --> 01:16:31.889
<v Westman, Claire>Are we allowed to give examples we in
supporting our argument?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9389-0
01:16:31.889 --> 01:16:33.849
<v Westman, Claire>Yes, if you want to, you absolutely can.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9392-0
01:16:36.619 --> 01:16:36.859
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9395-0
01:16:37.979 --> 01:16:40.139
<v Westman, Claire>All right, I don't think.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9402-0
01:16:42.219 --> 01:16:45.739
<v Westman, Claire>There's anything else here I need to
attend to specifically?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9405-0
01:16:47.459 --> 01:16:49.339
<v Westman, Claire>Nothing seems.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9411-0
01:16:52.139 --> 01:16:53.059
<v Westman, Claire>Oh yes you can.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9436-0
01:16:53.059 --> 01:16:56.483
<v Westman, Claire>Under forms,
without understanding the allegory of The</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9436-1
01:16:56.483 --> 01:16:59.285
<v Westman, Claire>Cave,
so the allegory of The Cave is just to</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9436-2
01:16:59.285 --> 01:17:00.779
<v Westman, Claire>help you get an idea of.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9438-0
01:17:02.379 --> 01:17:04.579
<v Westman, Claire>So that's Plato trying to explain.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9452-0
01:17:05.979 --> 01:17:10.659
<v Westman, Claire>How he thinks that sort of knowledge
works and our pursuit of knowledge works.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9473-0
01:17:10.779 --> 01:17:17.643
<v Westman, Claire>So he provided the allegory of The Cave
as a way to try and increase people's</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9473-1
01:17:17.643 --> 01:17:22.219
<v Westman, Claire>understanding of how he believes we gain
knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9491-0
01:17:22.849 --> 01:17:26.592
<v Westman, Claire>So if you understand the forms without
that, that's fine,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9491-1
01:17:26.592 --> 01:17:30.529
<v Westman, Claire>but at some point you might be asked to
explain a bit about.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9504-0
01:17:33.299 --> 01:17:36.219
<v Westman, Claire>What the allegory of The Cave says,
or to explain it.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9510-0
01:17:36.219 --> 01:17:39.979
<v Westman, Claire>So there's not a huge discussion about it
in the study guide.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9529-0
01:17:41.659 --> 01:17:45.981
<v Westman, Claire>But just having an understanding of it
can make it easier or can make it more</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9529-1
01:17:45.981 --> 01:17:47.699
<v Westman, Claire>understandable for some people.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9531-0
01:17:52.139 --> 01:17:52.699
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9534-0
01:18:01.039 --> 01:18:01.319
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9547-0
01:18:01.319 --> 01:18:06.704
<v Westman, Claire>Yes, the about waters H2O.
How does Plato count for 9 facts like</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9547-1
01:18:06.704 --> 01:18:07.119
<v Westman, Claire>that?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9559-0
01:18:07.119 --> 01:18:10.881
<v Westman, Claire>Because it seems like we have to have a
theory of chemistry before we can know</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9559-1
01:18:10.881 --> 01:18:11.119
<v Westman, Claire>that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9573-0
01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:14.799
<v Westman, Claire>But we can have a theory of chemistry
prior to investigation of the world.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9581-0
01:18:15.079 --> 01:18:18.919
<v Westman, Claire>Yeah, it's it's it gets a bit messy.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9585-0
01:18:18.919 --> 01:18:20.839
<v Westman, Claire>And again, we need to remember that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9590-0
01:18:22.359 --> 01:18:25.439
<v Westman, Claire>Plato comes from a time in which.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9594-0
01:18:26.979 --> 01:18:27.419
<v Westman, Claire>There wasn't.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9596-0
01:18:29.859 --> 01:18:29.979
<v Westman, Claire>Yet.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9607-0
01:18:31.619 --> 01:18:33.019
<v Westman, Claire>Scientific discovery as such.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9641-0
01:18:33.179 --> 01:18:38.431
<v Westman, Claire>So if we think about how Aristotle was
kind of, well,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9641-1
01:18:38.431 --> 01:18:46.017
<v Westman, Claire>we had the the Malaysians who sort of
started hinting at some scientific sort</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9641-2
01:18:46.017 --> 01:18:52.339
<v Westman, Claire>of inquiry. But Plato,
Aristotle is considered sort of the most.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9657-0
01:18:52.529 --> 01:18:58.571
<v Westman, Claire>Prominent ancient Greek philosopher
delving into sort of the scientific</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9657-1
01:18:58.571 --> 01:19:01.089
<v Westman, Claire>method and scientific inquiry.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9671-0
01:19:01.089 --> 01:19:06.969
<v Westman, Claire>So we need to remember also the time that
they came from that there wasn't really.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9710-0
01:19:08.899 --> 01:19:13.447
<v Westman, Claire>Such scientific inquiry as yet or
scientific thinking as yet,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9710-1
01:19:13.447 --> 01:19:18.730
<v Westman, Claire>and again this is some of the the
critique of Plato that comes up that,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9710-2
01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:22.398
<v Westman, Claire>you know,
he kind of just makes these assumptions</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9710-3
01:19:22.398 --> 01:19:23.499
<v Westman, Claire>or makes these.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9758-0
01:19:24.409 --> 01:19:31.187
<v Westman, Claire>Claims about the forms and knowledge of
the forms and these things existing and</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9758-1
01:19:31.187 --> 01:19:35.001
<v Westman, Claire>so you can very much argue if you wanted
to,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9758-2
01:19:35.001 --> 01:19:41.271
<v Westman, Claire>that the idea that things only exist in
our minds or for Plato like that,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9758-3
01:19:41.271 --> 01:19:46.779
<v Westman, Claire>that knowledge only exists through our
minds or beyond our mind.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9760-0
01:19:47.889 --> 01:19:48.769
<v Westman, Claire>Is not.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9762-0
01:19:49.499 --> 01:19:49.739
<v Westman, Claire>Really.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9766-0
01:19:51.499 --> 01:19:53.659
<v Westman, Claire>Rational or plausible?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9781-0
01:19:54.609 --> 01:19:58.303
<v Westman, Claire>So for, you know, like I said,
for you'll see with Aristotle,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9781-1
01:19:58.303 --> 01:20:00.329
<v Westman, Claire>he has a different take on it and.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9808-0
01:20:02.489 --> 01:20:06.638
<v Westman, Claire>The empiricists believe that we gain
knowledge through experience and sense</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9808-1
01:20:06.638 --> 01:20:09.531
<v Westman, Claire>experience,
and we have to have those perceptions in</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9808-2
01:20:09.531 --> 01:20:11.169
<v Westman, Claire>order to develop knowledge so.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9848-0
01:20:12.859 --> 01:20:17.509
<v Westman, Claire>It's it's very, you know,
again very good points and things that we</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9848-1
01:20:17.509 --> 01:20:20.928
<v Westman, Claire>will get into more as we go through this
for now.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9848-2
01:20:20.928 --> 01:20:26.331
<v Westman, Claire>Remember you're going to give an overview
of the idea of the forms you want to</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9848-3
01:20:26.331 --> 01:20:29.819
<v Westman, Claire>explain that. For Plato,
the form of the good was.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9851-0
01:20:29.819 --> 01:20:31.339
<v Westman, Claire>The highest good.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9865-0
01:20:31.889 --> 01:20:36.662
<v Westman, Claire>At the highest form that illuminated all
the other forms in the pursuit of the</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9865-1
01:20:36.662 --> 01:20:37.689
<v Westman, Claire>form of the good.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9881-0
01:20:39.179 --> 01:20:45.899
<v Westman, Claire>We use our rationality and our reason,
which are sort of our higher level.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9884-0
01:20:48.169 --> 01:20:49.129
<v Westman, Claire>Human pursuit.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9910-0
01:20:49.129 --> 01:20:55.884
<v Westman, Claire>It's through, you know,
focusing on human desires and experience,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9910-1
01:20:55.884 --> 01:21:03.049
<v Westman, Claire>sense experience that we sort of can give
in to less virtuous things.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9934-0
01:21:03.209 --> 01:21:08.469
<v Westman, Claire>So he thinks that if we're using our
reason and our rationality and we're</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9934-1
01:21:08.469 --> 01:21:13.089
<v Westman, Claire>pursuing knowledge of the good that we
can live a virtuous life.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9939-0
01:21:13.329 --> 01:21:15.969
<v Westman, Claire>So in that way virtue is dependent on
knowledge.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9947-0
01:21:16.169 --> 01:21:19.289
<v Westman, Claire>Because it's the pursuit of knowledge
that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9962-0
01:21:20.779 --> 01:21:24.779
<v Westman, Claire>Allows us or gives us the tools to live a
virtuous life.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9977-0
01:21:25.219 --> 01:21:28.909
<v Westman, Claire>Gives us the the temperament,
the characteristics,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9977-1
01:21:28.909 --> 01:21:31.659
<v Westman, Claire>the character to live a virtuous life.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9980-0
01:21:32.099 --> 01:21:32.299
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/9991-0
01:21:32.299 --> 01:21:35.019
<v Westman, Claire>So that's what you will need to focus on
for question 3.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10001-0
01:21:35.019 --> 01:21:38.063
<v Westman, Claire>Remember, it's 300 words,
so you can't go wild.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10001-1
01:21:38.063 --> 01:21:40.219
<v Westman, Claire>You can't include a whole lot, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10010-0
01:21:44.339 --> 01:21:45.059
<v Westman, Claire>Yes, of course.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10021-0
01:21:45.059 --> 01:21:47.065
<v Westman, Claire>Yes,
there's knowledge beyond the material</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10021-1
01:21:47.065 --> 01:21:48.979
<v Westman, Claire>world and that's where Plato was working.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10038-0
01:21:48.979 --> 01:21:53.421
<v Westman, Claire>There's both knowledge from experience
and also in this in the real world,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10038-1
01:21:53.421 --> 01:21:56.739
<v Westman, Claire>the place it talks about that does make
absolute sense.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10040-0
01:21:58.379 --> 01:21:58.499
<v Westman, Claire>But.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10052-0
01:22:01.719 --> 01:22:05.959
<v Westman, Claire>Yes, there's a recording of the class,
but for Plato he's a realist.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10063-0
01:22:05.999 --> 01:22:10.959
<v Westman, Claire>So for him,
the sensory experience is not important.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10066-0
01:22:11.119 --> 01:22:11.399
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10086-0
01:22:11.599 --> 01:22:15.049
<v Westman, Claire>So you will see that as we go through the
module,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10086-1
01:22:15.049 --> 01:22:20.639
<v Westman, Claire>there are other philosophers that say
that yes, sensory experience is important.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10095-0
01:22:22.139 --> 01:22:24.939
<v Westman, Claire>But we also have knowledge beyond the
material world.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10098-0
01:22:26.579 --> 01:22:27.779
<v Westman, Claire>Absolutely. OK. So.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10101-0
01:22:29.499 --> 01:22:30.459
<v Westman, Claire>That absolutely makes sense.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10108-0
01:22:31.649 --> 01:22:32.929
<v Westman, Claire>But he doesn't.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10111-0
01:22:33.569 --> 01:22:36.769
<v Westman, Claire>Plato is not a person who thinks that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10125-0
01:22:39.019 --> 01:22:42.139
<v Westman, Claire>We should focus on sensory experience or
that that's important.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10138-0
01:22:42.139 --> 01:22:45.055
<v Westman, Claire>Remember,
he wants us to sort of unburden ourselves</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10138-1
01:22:45.055 --> 01:22:47.579
<v Westman, Claire>of that and focus on reason and
rationality.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10150-0
01:22:49.609 --> 01:22:53.249
<v Westman, Claire>So I know things I don't know because of
ignorance.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10152-0
01:22:53.249 --> 01:22:54.009
<v Westman, Claire>Of what's real.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10171-0
01:22:55.539 --> 01:22:59.661
<v Westman, Claire>Basically, and it's also,
it's also like you as you study,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10171-1
01:22:59.661 --> 01:23:01.059
<v Westman, Claire>you're like, oh, OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10174-0
01:23:01.419 --> 01:23:03.339
<v Westman, Claire>I know the things that I don't know.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10181-0
01:23:05.059 --> 01:23:06.459
<v Westman, Claire>Because I know that I'm ignorant.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10191-0
01:23:07.059 --> 01:23:10.579
<v Westman, Claire>So you'll you'll you'll start to sort of
see that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10207-0
01:23:10.579 --> 01:23:14.542
<v Westman, Claire>So yes,
it's it's sort of summed up like that. OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10207-1
01:23:14.542 --> 01:23:18.739
<v Westman, Claire>I don't want to keep you much any longer.
And I also.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10210-0
01:23:20.419 --> 01:23:20.739
<v Westman, Claire>Left a.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10219-0
01:23:21.049 --> 01:23:24.449
<v Westman, Claire>Symposium for this class.
So I need to get back to that as well.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10229-0
01:23:26.059 --> 01:23:30.339
<v Westman, Claire>So is there anything absolutely urgent
that anyone needs to ask?</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10233-0
01:23:34.899 --> 01:23:36.019
<v Westman, Claire>Before tomorrow.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10236-0
01:23:40.399 --> 01:23:40.839
<v Westman, Claire>OK.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10243-0
01:23:41.679 --> 01:23:44.199
<v Westman, Claire>Remember, I'm saying this one last time.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10254-0
01:23:44.559 --> 01:23:47.399
<v Westman, Claire>You don't need to submit a page.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10257-0
01:23:47.399 --> 01:23:49.799
<v Westman, Claire>That's an honestly declaration.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10268-0
01:23:49.839 --> 01:23:53.959
<v Westman, Claire>There is a little box that you click when
you click on assessment one.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10272-0
01:23:54.079 --> 01:23:55.239
<v Westman, Claire>A box would come up.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10274-0
01:23:57.339 --> 01:23:57.659
<v Westman, Claire>That you click.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10279-0
01:23:59.459 --> 01:24:02.259
<v Westman, Claire>You can submit as PDF or word.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10288-0
01:24:04.979 --> 01:24:07.699
<v Westman, Claire>You don't need a cover page or a contents
page.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10292-0
01:24:07.699 --> 01:24:09.259
<v Westman, Claire>You can have them if you want to.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10303-0
01:24:09.609 --> 01:24:13.329
<v Westman, Claire>It's good practice to get to do them,
but you don't have to.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10321-0
01:24:13.409 --> 01:24:17.581
<v Westman, Claire>There is no specific format for the
contents page or cover page.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10321-1
01:24:17.581 --> 01:24:21.369
<v Westman, Claire>If you want to do them,
just come up with your own format.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10339-0
01:24:22.899 --> 01:24:27.399
<v Westman, Claire>Remember you submit on the system,
so your name and student number is</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10339-1
01:24:27.399 --> 01:24:28.299
<v Westman, Claire>already there.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10345-0
01:24:28.299 --> 01:24:31.219
<v Westman, Claire>There is no turn it in for this
assessment.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10352-0
01:24:31.739 --> 01:24:34.659
<v Westman, Claire>Turn it in is only for the second
assessment.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10354-0
01:24:38.459 --> 01:24:39.099
<v Westman, Claire>Wait, hold on.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10361-0
01:24:39.369 --> 01:24:41.769
<v Westman, Claire>Let me just check that before I continue.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10365-0
01:24:42.009 --> 01:24:44.169
<v Westman, Claire>Sorry, I you know I've got.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10369-0
01:24:44.169 --> 01:24:45.049
<v Westman, Claire>I've got a few modules.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10379-0
01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:51.099
<v Westman, Claire>So let me just 100% check.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10394-0
01:24:51.099 --> 01:24:56.054
<v Westman, Claire>But as far as I know, for this one no.
So for this assessment,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10394-1
01:24:56.054 --> 01:24:58.099
<v Westman, Claire>you're not using turnitin.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10411-0
01:25:04.069 --> 01:25:08.229
<v Westman, Claire>So you don't need to worry about tuning
in this time.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10422-0
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:12.938
<v Westman, Claire>You there are external plagiarism
checkers you can use if you're concerned</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10422-1
01:25:12.938 --> 01:25:13.629
<v Westman, Claire>about that.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10424-0
01:25:15.139 --> 01:25:15.339
<v Westman, Claire>Sorry.</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10467-0
01:25:17.259 --> 01:25:20.417
<v Westman, Claire>But for the second assessment,
there will be turnitin,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10467-1
01:25:20.417 --> 01:25:24.608
<v Westman, Claire>OK and then turnitin is built into the
system. So as soon as you submit,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10467-2
01:25:24.608 --> 01:25:28.054
<v Westman, Claire>it will well not as soon as you submit
and it goes through,</v>

e6c656c8-0109-46ab-b4f0-7b8247cd2b3c/10467-3
01:25:28.054 --> 01:25:31.499
<v Westman, Claire>turn it in and then you get your report.
It can take somet.</v>
