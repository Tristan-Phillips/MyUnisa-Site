5052f44e-ce4f-4eab-aff8-419c9e97293d-0
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.718
I'm going to be showing you how to use
the databases,

5052f44e-ce4f-4eab-aff8-419c9e97293d-1
00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:13.419
which provides you with access to
hundreds of different journals and

5052f44e-ce4f-4eab-aff8-419c9e97293d-2
00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.256
thousands of different articles and book
chapters, which will be very,

5052f44e-ce4f-4eab-aff8-419c9e97293d-3
00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:22.480
very valuable for when you're doing
research for assignments.

211422ff-77c2-4ae0-8ae0-ebae9f940f35-0
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.812
So this is a tool that you must learn how
to use as a student because it is going

211422ff-77c2-4ae0-8ae0-ebae9f940f35-1
00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:34.528
to be vital that you do research of your
own and that you use research that is

211422ff-77c2-4ae0-8ae0-ebae9f940f35-2
00:00:34.528 --> 00:00:36.120
credible and academic.

38fcbedd-3e13-4c76-98f4-738a92b6f97e-0
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.259
And these databases that are provided by
Unisa to us for free are excellent

38fcbedd-3e13-4c76-98f4-738a92b6f97e-1
00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:46.880
resources for researching.

c167a6ca-eeea-4391-81a0-0f0712042201-0
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.359
We are actually very fortunate that Unisa
provides us access to all of these

c167a6ca-eeea-4391-81a0-0f0712042201-1
00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.451
journals and articles for free because
otherwise they are very expensive to

c167a6ca-eeea-4391-81a0-0f0712042201-2
00:00:57.451 --> 00:00:57.920
access.

fc7f4d23-389a-47ab-80ec-037cad6f0a20-0
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.041
So please make sure that you understand
how to access the databases and that you

fc7f4d23-389a-47ab-80ec-037cad6f0a20-1
00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:09.412
make sure that you are using them
regularly as a place to do your research

fc7f4d23-389a-47ab-80ec-037cad6f0a20-2
00:01:09.412 --> 00:01:13.280
for your assignments throughout your
academic career.

864bdd21-bc6c-4a39-a408-f233c545c881-0
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.600
So I'm going to show you how to use those
in this video.

bcaa4650-d3f1-4d51-b442-14dbfd047e05-0
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.120
It's very easy once you get to know how
to use them.

63b808e4-da2a-49c7-ac6e-971c109647c4-0
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.760
So the first thing we'll do is you can
see we're on the Myunisa page.

b60911cc-37a0-4938-8b99-507f263234b4-0
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.480
You're going to click on Library,
which will open a new page.

17c4484e-bc46-4803-a224-5397484cc5e5-0
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.920
So as you can see,
we are now on the library page.

0a9ff7e4-2c6d-4a16-8222-865b183c094c-0
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.415
There is a lot of information on this
page,

0a9ff7e4-2c6d-4a16-8222-865b183c094c-1
00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:43.067
so please make sure that you go through
it carefully and that you look at all the

0a9ff7e4-2c6d-4a16-8222-865b183c094c-2
00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:45.960
resources that are supplied to you by the
library.

3a49caac-da33-4565-8c9f-52ce473bd5f9-0
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.513
They are very useful for you as a student
and will help you be more successful in

3a49caac-da33-4565-8c9f-52ce473bd5f9-1
00:01:51.513 --> 00:01:52.880
your university career.

92c3563b-a269-48f7-9e8a-8263121d2fb2-0
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.860
So please take full advantage of all of
the resources that are supplied to you or

92c3563b-a269-48f7-9e8a-8263121d2fb2-1
00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.760
provided to you by the university.

8fcf12a1-91e5-4753-b6cd-5bf64f1ec0d5-0
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.080
You can see that it offers services for
new students, for undergraduate students.

6947d727-f064-42a0-b169-ab124422f34b-0
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.767
If you have any special needs,
the library can assist you and there's a

6947d727-f064-42a0-b169-ab124422f34b-1
00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:13.720
lot of information on here.

459750bf-20ae-4eb9-868c-08db93a9a77c-0
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.040
So there's various kinds of training that
are offered by the library.

f0f459c2-a1a6-4fe2-80b6-4b5de7fb3f18-0
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.322
So please make sure that you do go look
through this page and see what is

f0f459c2-a1a6-4fe2-80b6-4b5de7fb3f18-1
00:02:22.322 --> 00:02:25.320
available to you through the library site.

5371ce87-b6f9-4cda-b225-6a0e983a7cb7-0
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.938
I am, however,
not going to focus on any of that for

5371ce87-b6f9-4cda-b225-6a0e983a7cb7-1
00:02:29.938 --> 00:02:30.640
this video.

dfbaa5d5-6735-4fb5-bda7-2773c1e49ce9-0
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.760
Instead we are going to focus here on
finding E resources.

5e878d46-bf28-400c-8f7f-15afefe6f083-0
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.800
So you will see here in this area you
will click on Find E Resources.

0de441c5-019a-4617-abce-9e2f4bdb7a9e-0
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.960
This will open a new tab and once it is
opened you will see this page.

1345f17e-daa6-415a-95ab-ffcb77f7fc0c-0
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.520
So you can see here that it says A-Z
databases.

102211d3-adc0-4fda-8389-83b83466d817-0
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.040
So that is where you want to be.

16e5056f-144b-417e-a0da-b095392b0be4-0
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.796
You can also see that it provides you
information for how to access the

16e5056f-144b-417e-a0da-b095392b0be4-1
00:03:00.796 --> 00:03:02.760
databases for the first time.

fab199cb-e392-4f76-b7cf-fd04df5ae4c1-0
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.987
So you will need to follow these steps in
order to have access to the databases and

fab199cb-e392-4f76-b7cf-fd04df5ae4c1-1
00:03:08.987 --> 00:03:10.680
the the library resources.

8ef9a8ca-8034-4c0d-ba0b-930832967f5b-0
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.796
So it says, yeah, as a university student,
you need to as a Unisa student,

8ef9a8ca-8034-4c0d-ba0b-930832967f5b-1
00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:21.186
you need to use your student number as
the username to log in and your my life

8ef9a8ca-8034-4c0d-ba0b-930832967f5b-2
00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:21.800
password.

3e32019b-9a38-46a5-a260-6e380d5d0b51-0
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.440
I'm already logged in so I don't have to
go through that step today.

9d176fb3-8481-4584-882f-ea17a92192e2-0
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.255
So we won't see that in this video,
but that is how you will access the

9d176fb3-8481-4584-882f-ea17a92192e2-1
00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:34.840
database is how you will log in.

7044a890-3614-41eb-bd6a-eebbc81a07ae-0
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.206
If you have any difficulties logging in
or need any assistance with using the

7044a890-3614-41eb-bd6a-eebbc81a07ae-1
00:03:40.206 --> 00:03:43.609
databases,
please e-mail this library e-mail address

7044a890-3614-41eb-bd6a-eebbc81a07ae-2
00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.920
and they will be able to assist you.

4a430562-d0a1-4083-8049-e675f57ed0bc-0
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.000
So once we are here in the A-Z databases,
you can see there is a lot of information.

375a77cb-6ae8-4f6f-84cf-2646b8208536-0
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.308
Firstly,
you can see there's all these search

375a77cb-6ae8-4f6f-84cf-2646b8208536-1
00:03:57.308 --> 00:03:58.320
options for you.

fa8d69ad-4f81-4fd2-9b1b-c0e925544bf4-0
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.234
You can see there's feature databases,
there are child databases,

fa8d69ad-4f81-4fd2-9b1b-c0e925544bf4-1
00:04:04.234 --> 00:04:06.240
there are helpful links.

26bf79b0-2f04-49dd-a2ec-ad654200d004-0
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.303
So there's a lot of information and it
can seem a little bit overwhelming when

26bf79b0-2f04-49dd-a2ec-ad654200d004-1
00:04:11.303 --> 00:04:16.144
you first start to use these databases,
but please don't let it put you off using

26bf79b0-2f04-49dd-a2ec-ad654200d004-2
00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:16.440
them.

68815185-b6f3-404e-8702-af0cd7d9e509-0
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.230
They are very simple to use once you know
what you're doing,

68815185-b6f3-404e-8702-af0cd7d9e509-1
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.120
once you have a very basic idea of how to
use them.

1d60e696-a334-4b37-a739-ec9815fe5ba2-0
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.840
So firstly, let's just look.

d4d789b0-fca5-418b-a482-507cbd91c630-0
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.280
Here we are.

9275b73b-040a-4322-8f9f-899ebed48fc0-0
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.800
We are seeing all the databases that are
available.

3d2bce2e-9d66-49ca-b043-5d9c88f631a1-0
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.641
You can choose by alphabetical order or
by choose a letter of the alphabet to

3d2bce2e-9d66-49ca-b043-5d9c88f631a1-1
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:41.558
narrow down the databases that you are
looking at because you'll see there are

3d2bce2e-9d66-49ca-b043-5d9c88f631a1-2
00:04:41.558 --> 00:04:43.879
591 databases available to you.

0d3942a6-ddd4-447f-af2e-c2f1fa839ac8-0
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.760
However, again,
just keep it simple for now.

b75114d6-6d95-463d-8b42-07d994eb989e-0
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.163
We'll just stick with all and you'll see
that we are seeing the letter A for now,

b75114d6-6d95-463d-8b42-07d994eb989e-1
00:04:55.163 --> 00:05:01.476
and there are many different databases
which give you an explanation of what

b75114d6-6d95-463d-8b42-07d994eb989e-2
00:05:01.476 --> 00:05:06.560
those databases are about or what kinds
of topics they cover.

e52324b1-45a4-4ef0-a589-b18502e284fd-0
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.942
So you can see here that this ABI Inform
Global covers specifically business

e52324b1-45a4-4ef0-a589-b18502e284fd-1
00:05:12.942 --> 00:05:16.000
periodicals and Business Research topics.

fbd0e05e-efc5-4ec1-ab59-85a6e6042e13-0
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.240
So that might not be so useful for your
purposes.

1cc70a8d-06bd-459f-81ef-c69be57504e1-0
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.471
We can Scroll down and we'll see here
that this Access engineering obviously

1cc70a8d-06bd-459f-81ef-c69be57504e1-1
00:05:27.471 --> 00:05:33.200
focuses on engineering articles and
engineering information.

38c420e5-ecf8-424c-8179-d6e4a67ad57d-0
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.400
So again,
that might not be relevant to you.

455cbe79-abcc-4df4-86b5-f7fc34a5ad7c-0
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.941
This database looks at newspapers at
local, regional, national,

455cbe79-abcc-4df4-86b5-f7fc34a5ad7c-1
00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:42.840
and international levels.

d9b769f1-2dae-4939-96f6-5df9c410e72f-0
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.451
So if you wanted information that was
specifically in a newspaper,

d9b769f1-2dae-4939-96f6-5df9c410e72f-1
00:05:47.451 --> 00:05:50.560
this might be a database that you would
look at.

213c318d-2182-46f5-b33b-3413a9780f58-0
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:58.160
So play around on the site to see which
databases might be most relevant for you.

75f60381-5121-4a72-a9fc-eb9c9763783c-0
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.953
There are databases specifically for
philosophy,

75f60381-5121-4a72-a9fc-eb9c9763783c-1
00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:09.556
and if you wanted to look for those you
could then go here and type in the

75f60381-5121-4a72-a9fc-eb9c9763783c-2
00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:15.807
subject or look for the subject of
philosophy and then narrow down the

75f60381-5121-4a72-a9fc-eb9c9763783c-3
00:06:15.807 --> 00:06:17.480
search using those.

964e1a28-ad70-4676-bbe2-1e393a89fb3d-0
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.694
However, as new users of the database,
I always suggest that you use a

964e1a28-ad70-4676-bbe2-1e393a89fb3d-1
00:06:24.694 --> 00:06:27.240
multidisciplinary database.

14badb41-1f07-455e-ae3f-d779a041a771-0
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.760
So here we can see Academic Search
Ultimate.

3f7052d1-b084-400d-9434-32a6854175d0-0
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.351
This is a multidisciplinary full text
database containing full text for more

3f7052d1-b084-400d-9434-32a6854175d0-1
00:06:37.351 --> 00:06:38.840
than 4600 journals.

6ff979a5-3f2f-42c5-b078-a87b1e6caaab-0
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:47.591
So what multidisciplinary means is it
covers a broad range of subjects and this

6ff979a5-3f2f-42c5-b078-a87b1e6caaab-1
00:06:47.591 --> 00:06:54.400
database specifically contains full text
articles, chapters, etcetera.

5f8626f8-767b-44d3-a0eb-85fc09c9f83a-0
00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:01.038
So that's very important because there
are some databases that will only give

5f8626f8-767b-44d3-a0eb-85fc09c9f83a-1
00:07:01.038 --> 00:07:06.826
you access to abstracts for articles or
summaries of book chapters,

5f8626f8-767b-44d3-a0eb-85fc09c9f83a-2
00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:13.294
or even only just the bibliographic
information of an article or chapter or

5f8626f8-767b-44d3-a0eb-85fc09c9f83a-3
00:07:13.294 --> 00:07:13.720
book.

30925f53-5bd5-4cb5-b22b-6d28ab9c9e07-0
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.703
And then you would have to go look on
another database for the full text,

30925f53-5bd5-4cb5-b22b-6d28ab9c9e07-1
00:07:18.703 --> 00:07:21.640
so for the whole article or the whole
chapter.

889f77a0-c104-4063-9269-072758fbf863-0
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.400
So when you're searching,
especially at this stage,

889f77a0-c104-4063-9269-072758fbf863-1
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.440
it is best to look for ones that offer
full text.

563a75af-82cd-46b0-b9f3-c932e2b54751-0
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.360
And this particular database is one of my
favorite to use.

504121a7-4798-466c-a61b-61f775383ce9-0
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.480
It's the one I use most often.

dd0b83ae-5990-4196-99b3-a054b984fcbe-0
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.875
It's very easy to use,
although most of them,

dd0b83ae-5990-4196-99b3-a054b984fcbe-1
00:07:39.875 --> 00:07:44.760
once you have an idea of how to use one,
they basically all work the same.

828cb876-4159-4953-a3ce-9f675f485341-0
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.851
But this one covers such a broad range of
topics and I find it one of the most

828cb876-4159-4953-a3ce-9f675f485341-1
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:50.960
useful ones to use.

de1e2aff-eadc-411a-80ae-9369b89c9ae4-0
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.000
So we'll look at this one today in this
video.

71eee9f4-e31a-42aa-bca3-ef3fd58ae318-0
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.200
So we click there and again,
it opens in another tab.

02125928-3515-47f5-a0ad-9d58d80301cb-0
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.660
So then you'll see once it's opened,
it will take you to this page,

02125928-3515-47f5-a0ad-9d58d80301cb-1
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.869
you will see that you have your own
dashboard where you can create projects

02125928-3515-47f5-a0ad-9d58d80301cb-2
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:09.760
for yourself.

cba79d4b-cce3-46e1-9281-6a7cffff4349-0
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.584
You can save items onto your dashboard,
It can show you the recent activity,

cba79d4b-cce3-46e1-9281-6a7cffff4349-1
00:08:15.584 --> 00:08:19.360
You can set up alerts for specific kinds
of articles.

76058abe-b7bc-45af-8318-c6cf16e711e9-0
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.480
But again,
you might not be comfortable doing those

76058abe-b7bc-45af-8318-c6cf16e711e9-1
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.320
at this stage.

1834fba2-cd6c-4031-b62e-e6727358731e-0
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.773
So once you're more comfortable,
those are some of the things that you

1834fba2-cd6c-4031-b62e-e6727358731e-1
00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:28.600
might look at doing.

0572e81b-047f-437d-abc5-71b89b839f9a-0
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.834
Here we have our search bar and you can
see that there are again,

0572e81b-047f-437d-abc5-71b89b839f9a-1
00:08:34.834 --> 00:08:38.120
various options to narrow down your
searches.

8ec9eaff-194a-4a1b-825f-33e86428d45b-0
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.550
To filter your search,
you might want to look at only peer

8ec9eaff-194a-4a1b-825f-33e86428d45b-1
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:45.040
reviewed, only full text, but again,
this is all full text.

5b940a25-a8f1-4fd2-a096-f9b1bf0f9ca6-0
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.198
You might want to look at specific
publication dates,

5b940a25-a8f1-4fd2-a096-f9b1bf0f9ca6-1
00:08:49.198 --> 00:08:52.365
which is not always necessary for
philosophy,

5b940a25-a8f1-4fd2-a096-f9b1bf0f9ca6-2
00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:56.152
but if you were doing something like
computer science,

5b940a25-a8f1-4fd2-a096-f9b1bf0f9ca6-3
00:08:56.152 --> 00:08:59.320
you might want only the most recent
articles.

2ad87e30-6aed-401d-b9c5-a3c347e59a3f-0
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.640
Then you could narrow it down.

a06007f0-8b53-4b86-9e8e-2d0c04c9db76-0
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.840
You can look at publication types,
you can look for specific languages.

2a2e309c-8c94-4de1-8915-073810791d3d-0
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.402
So there are ways to narrow down your
search so that you get fewer results when

2a2e309c-8c94-4de1-8915-073810791d3d-1
00:09:11.402 --> 00:09:12.600
you do your search.

a52c124f-0bbf-4386-848b-917358a44bdc-0
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.157
But again, for at this stage,
try and just keep it as uncomplicated as

a52c124f-0bbf-4386-848b-917358a44bdc-1
00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:18.760
possible.

c96e7467-f82c-47be-8385-0aff56176b1f-0
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.520
So we are going to search for in this
video, Plato's Theory of Forms.

9cf5ff7a-10fc-4460-930d-9b8d872460ab-0
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.440
So we can see it even comes up there for
us.

5bba1017-7655-4e2f-a739-41a2c6cef143-0
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.960
Again,
you could narrow down here if you wanted

5bba1017-7655-4e2f-a739-41a2c6cef143-1
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.520
to specifically look for one author,
if you wanted to look for certain just

5bba1017-7655-4e2f-a739-41a2c6cef143-2
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.960
subject terms, etcetera.

eac5f732-8978-45d9-b517-2a60da4bdddc-0
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.522
You could also say Plato's Theory of the
Forms and Allegory of The Cave,

eac5f732-8978-45d9-b517-2a60da4bdddc-1
00:09:42.522 --> 00:09:47.940
which would then give you only articles
that discuss Plato's Theory of the Forms

eac5f732-8978-45d9-b517-2a60da4bdddc-2
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.880
and the Allegory of The Cave.

90bd74b4-183c-4241-a17f-70739fe31ecf-0
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.160
Or you could say Plato's Theory of Forms
or the Allegory of The Cave.

8b004466-f3e2-43a6-91f1-32283014ca40-0
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.888
Then it would give you articles that
showed you Theory of the Forms or

8b004466-f3e2-43a6-91f1-32283014ca40-1
00:09:58.888 --> 00:09:59.920
Allegory of The Cave.

013e255f-d12f-4eb8-b7e2-744eff94fe6e-0
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.440
Or you might say Plato's Theory of Forms,
not Allegory of The Cave.

7aa7fe87-6b27-4665-bec6-fe95bd97985b-0
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:12.285
Then it would show you only articles that
discuss the Theory of Forms and that do

7aa7fe87-6b27-4665-bec6-fe95bd97985b-1
00:10:12.285 --> 00:10:16.400
not discuss anything about the Allegory
of The Cave.

1f0f501d-50ef-4c1a-8d61-7160bd64e34d-0
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.480
Once again, we're just keeping it simple.

b028c3a3-f921-416b-a64c-dbe3d9c2191a-0
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.040
We're going to search Plato's theory of
forms.

705f47b0-a8b4-4667-bebd-108860dd88eb-0
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:30.551
We will click search and it will bring up
this page so we can see now that 50

705f47b0-a8b4-4667-bebd-108860dd88eb-1
00:10:30.551 --> 00:10:32.800
results have come up.

df053300-b0fd-4190-ae3e-0193f856ab1a-0
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:38.306
Sometimes you will get hundreds of
results and then you might need to try

df053300-b0fd-4190-ae3e-0193f856ab1a-1
00:10:38.306 --> 00:10:44.240
and filter down your search and narrow it
down a little bit so this isn't too many.

88fc31ed-1a49-4802-9c5c-d83a3e5c4257-0
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.840
So we can just look through these for now.

db974682-423c-4cbc-bd40-710cd4d9aa47-0
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.600
Obviously we won't look through all of
them.

bafc77fe-32e8-4f53-9596-23cc69376b0b-0
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:56.689
Something important that I want you to
take note of is what it says at the top

bafc77fe-32e8-4f53-9596-23cc69376b0b-1
00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:59.200
of each of the listed options.

1aa0c11e-b31a-41cc-b2fb-c41f13fcda96-0
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.760
So you can see here that this says review.

3c7ba105-aae1-422a-87b2-6bba408c0587-0
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.183
Now,
a review is when somebody has written a

3c7ba105-aae1-422a-87b2-6bba408c0587-1
00:11:06.183 --> 00:11:09.800
review of another book,
another person's book.

d0b16a0b-011b-48c3-9808-a4b08966eb22-0
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.123
So they are not always very useful for
your purposes of assignment writing

d0b16a0b-011b-48c3-9808-a4b08966eb22-1
00:11:15.123 --> 00:11:20.311
because they just give an explanation of
the book and a review of that book that

d0b16a0b-011b-48c3-9808-a4b08966eb22-2
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:21.400
has been written.

60835341-a19e-4a04-9fee-91cc7e6b2120-0
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.279
If we Scroll down, we can see here,
for example,

60835341-a19e-4a04-9fee-91cc7e6b2120-1
00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:30.720
that this says it's a peer reviewed
article in an academic journal.

df899f72-5b03-4c95-861c-ef94c3730150-0
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.760
So that is more along the lines of what
you're going to be looking for.

bab14700-0577-4a41-a5f1-a9d4a87e6b18-0
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.506
Remember,
peer reviewed means that it has gone

bab14700-0577-4a41-a5f1-a9d4a87e6b18-1
00:11:38.506 --> 00:11:43.996
through a process where the article or
chapter has been submitted to a journal

bab14700-0577-4a41-a5f1-a9d4a87e6b18-2
00:11:43.996 --> 00:11:49.347
or a book and then it has been sent out
to other people in the field who are

bab14700-0577-4a41-a5f1-a9d4a87e6b18-3
00:11:49.347 --> 00:11:50.319
knowledgeable.

50b35490-9fbf-45b1-a1c5-6a8ecdb7de13-0
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.994
So in the case of philosophy,
it might have been sent to other

50b35490-9fbf-45b1-a1c5-6a8ecdb7de13-1
00:11:54.994 --> 00:12:00.560
philosophy lecturers or professors who
will have read through the article.

3fe95691-e973-4e12-ba6e-ebbcc003e3cf-0
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:07.319
Given extensive feedback to the author,
the article may then have been revised

3fe95691-e973-4e12-ba6e-ebbcc003e3cf-1
00:12:07.319 --> 00:12:08.640
and resubmitted.

a0ed6ecf-dafc-4eaa-9d9d-76e43cccc6d5-0
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.232
But this process ensures that the
information that is contained in the

a0ed6ecf-dafc-4eaa-9d9d-76e43cccc6d5-1
00:12:14.232 --> 00:12:17.400
article is reliable and that it's
accurate.

90d1500e-d7f9-45b9-b9a1-126255d6062b-0
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.920
And so that is the kind of information
that you are looking for.

7e057b49-1dd2-48a5-bb74-05dd8d7e88ec-0
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:28.703
So This is why we say to you that you
shouldn't use things that are,

7e057b49-1dd2-48a5-bb74-05dd8d7e88ec-1
00:12:28.703 --> 00:12:35.599
for example blogs or on Wikipedia or use
YouTube videos as sources in your

7e057b49-1dd2-48a5-bb74-05dd8d7e88ec-2
00:12:35.599 --> 00:12:40.840
assessments because those are not peer
reviewed sources.

e1545c09-c939-4514-8cff-4b4a34902f4c-0
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.080
So in a blog or on Wikipedia,
anyone can write what they want.

2fa9662e-476f-403a-b734-c467638c895c-0
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.089
It is not checked to see if it is
credible, if the information is accurate,

2fa9662e-476f-403a-b734-c467638c895c-1
00:12:51.089 --> 00:12:52.200
if it is reliable.

f7401acd-2be6-4658-8f85-704f3d1366c8-0
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.960
So those are why we don't consider those
good academic sources.

a6651862-ebc7-4fe9-978f-d9444db7d211-0
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:03.364
But the information that you find on
these databases is generally good

a6651862-ebc7-4fe9-978f-d9444db7d211-1
00:13:03.364 --> 00:13:06.640
information from good academic sources.

18b06112-bf63-4c20-b047-89b4892378e2-0
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.800
So that is what you'll be looking for.

9cd8d3b7-5bd3-401d-8f0f-d069147fdc62-0
00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.086
So again,
you can see there are a lot of different

9cd8d3b7-5bd3-401d-8f0f-d069147fdc62-1
00:13:13.086 --> 00:13:14.400
options to look at.

1c968603-b266-494b-a280-f87761907c46-0
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.040
So we're just going to go here.

b7f05e2d-fd2e-408b-8f3d-4ebbad546502-0
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.800
We'll go to this article.

aacca6c9-91ad-4da9-82bd-a2e848bc91ad-0
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.605
You can see it's an article,
you can see the author where the journals

aacca6c9-91ad-4da9-82bd-a2e848bc91ad-1
00:13:23.605 --> 00:13:25.840
was published in, when it was published.

7cf727c9-d3a8-4848-b8e0-fe5ed000ab02-0
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.456
And then importantly,
you see a summary or an abstract of the

7cf727c9-d3a8-4848-b8e0-fe5ed000ab02-1
00:13:30.456 --> 00:13:31.000
article.

0f0ee1ba-96d4-47be-a246-b1065180c79a-0
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:37.000
You can also see subjects that are
contained within the article or that the

0f0ee1ba-96d4-47be-a246-b1065180c79a-1
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.360
article relates to.

7ca553c4-2b14-4351-8249-34aa10b78416-0
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.123
So it's very,
very important that you always read the

7ca553c4-2b14-4351-8249-34aa10b78416-1
00:13:43.123 --> 00:13:48.720
summary or the abstract because this
tells you what the article is about.

d69c99a4-1528-4958-b030-fc1df91942f8-0
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.746
You don't want to go and read articles
that are 20 to 30 pages long and only

d69c99a4-1528-4958-b030-fc1df91942f8-1
00:13:54.746 --> 00:14:00.142
once you've read 30 pages realize that it
is not relevant to the assessment you are

d69c99a4-1528-4958-b030-fc1df91942f8-2
00:14:00.142 --> 00:14:05.217
doing or the information isn't anything
related to what you are writing about,

d69c99a4-1528-4958-b030-fc1df91942f8-3
00:14:05.217 --> 00:14:07.079
then you've wasted your time.

85fc069b-84e5-4fa7-b4de-8240c85748e5-0
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:14.920
So you rather want to look for articles
that are relevant to what you are doing.

6607bdda-1847-412c-8776-4d105064428d-0
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:26.760
So here we can see that this article
talks about Plato's theory of the forms.

36553d69-5dd6-4354-8c2e-b32141a3f514-0
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:32.210
It's a novel interpretation,
so this might not be exactly what you

36553d69-5dd6-4354-8c2e-b32141a3f514-1
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.590
want for your purposes,
but this is just to show you how to

36553d69-5dd6-4354-8c2e-b32141a3f514-2
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.319
access it.

a1d801cc-d739-47a6-a418-4e4dca3d7666-0
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.502
So we can either click here,
which will then open all of the

a1d801cc-d739-47a6-a418-4e4dca3d7666-1
00:14:41.502 --> 00:14:43.560
information about the article.

7802cf47-f245-44bb-9cc9-aa8edd65ed5b-0
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:52.157
You can also click on related items,
which will show you other articles that

7802cf47-f245-44bb-9cc9-aa8edd65ed5b-1
00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:56.840
have similar contents or similar subject
matter.

20459776-6a86-42a7-b184-fec1d9df477a-0
00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.403
So you can go through those and that can
help you to look for other articles that

20459776-6a86-42a7-b184-fec1d9df477a-1
00:15:01.403 --> 00:15:02.680
might be useful for you.

76a5bb0a-1b54-42e1-b9cd-71d0b04bf2aa-0
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.280
But for now, we'll stay on details.

f03d1102-bd87-4dae-95a5-d43cdc9557e4-0
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.989
Again, here's the abstract,
but we're we're going to click now is

f03d1102-bd87-4dae-95a5-d43cdc9557e4-1
00:15:11.989 --> 00:15:15.600
access now and this will open a new tab
again.

8a075b95-807e-4ca2-99e4-38be229f05c7-0
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.640
And in this tab it opens a PDF document.

5cce172f-12ba-429a-a0d9-a005b8085a24-0
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.400
So you can then go and read the article.

256d73ee-62d4-40c1-b22c-91e1c437ec50-0
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.404
I always suggest that you first scroll
through the article,

256d73ee-62d4-40c1-b22c-91e1c437ec50-1
00:15:28.404 --> 00:15:33.758
skim over it quickly to again,
make sure that it is an article that is

256d73ee-62d4-40c1-b22c-91e1c437ec50-2
00:15:33.758 --> 00:15:35.040
relevant for you.

323a6694-0c74-42be-8c26-9cca575f95a0-0
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.460
You can also begin by reading the
abstract, the introduction,

323a6694-0c74-42be-8c26-9cca575f95a0-1
00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:44.267
and the conclusion so that you know that
this is something that you should be

323a6694-0c74-42be-8c26-9cca575f95a0-2
00:15:44.267 --> 00:15:44.760
reading.

01cdfdce-548a-47ba-b2dd-97bccde1fbd9-0
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.760
Once you know you want to read it,
you can either read it here and do

01cdfdce-548a-47ba-b2dd-97bccde1fbd9-1
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.584
markups on this online document,
or you can download it, share it,

01cdfdce-548a-47ba-b2dd-97bccde1fbd9-2
00:15:55.584 --> 00:15:59.760
whatever you want to do once you have
this document open.

052a26b5-14e7-440c-9553-81779b7b8396-0
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.560
So that's one way that you can find the
articles.

3d0e5e1a-226c-42f8-b3c2-ee74f4db6503-0
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:12.920
Another way that you might find is if we
go back to our search.

f0e7116a-7a22-4387-8d97-54a976820457-0
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.640
So we'll just go back here.

d398be95-bfe0-4f47-adb6-0a844787c0a2-0
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.760
Sometimes you will see that you're given
access options, so you can click there.

8a5fb319-8f09-4c76-b04b-fc933679b079-0
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.800
OK, this is only the full text,
so let's look at another one.

89223310-44b2-4665-80a9-9d1b0722e4fc-0
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.720
Again, full text.

bcc1ae8a-18d3-463c-ad5f-179ac791a0a6-0
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.800
All the ones we're seeing are only full
text here.

7ac0da2e-1608-459b-a12c-4b3a0284cc8f-0
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.610
OK,
here you can see you can either open a

7ac0da2e-1608-459b-a12c-4b3a0284cc8f-1
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:42.805
PDF or you can open an online full text
which will then open another screen and

7ac0da2e-1608-459b-a12c-4b3a0284cc8f-2
00:16:42.805 --> 00:16:48.613
it will give you this table of contents
on the side to be able to navigate

7ac0da2e-1608-459b-a12c-4b3a0284cc8f-3
00:16:48.613 --> 00:16:50.240
through the document.

d0ebc8b7-bc38-488c-aa08-9d53dfd3e222-0
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:56.960
So there are various ways of opening the
documents.

cdb90a58-66a7-4bfe-bd45-ea74c402e89c-0
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.609
Most often it will be a PDF,
but sometimes there will be other things

cdb90a58-66a7-4bfe-bd45-ea74c402e89c-1
00:17:01.609 --> 00:17:06.711
like an online text or it will take you
to a different page where you'll have to

cdb90a58-66a7-4bfe-bd45-ea74c402e89c-2
00:17:06.711 --> 00:17:08.160
download it from there.

35f40a9f-8061-405f-b929-9499c14207b5-0
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.720
So if you click on Show more results,
then you will see other results.

f7ac257a-91c8-47b8-b794-1c142de9e55c-0
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.200
Now for example,
here we can see that's in Greek.

c92d6e2c-4b5e-4d4f-897d-0b84ccf98f6d-0
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.440
So maybe you want to rule those out.

6e4bc81e-9898-4af4-adf8-6ddb1aaeefb9-0
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.960
You want to only look for English or
whatever language.

1977aac1-4610-443e-a298-809b3b996b3f-0
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.554
So you can then just scroll through and
see and look for what is most valuable

1977aac1-4610-443e-a298-809b3b996b3f-1
00:17:29.554 --> 00:17:30.080
for you.

652c8552-e290-4f89-b176-9721bfd6af5a-0
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.991
Again,
if you wanted to save it to your page or

652c8552-e290-4f89-b176-9721bfd6af5a-1
00:17:33.991 --> 00:17:38.014
your dashboard,
you would click on this little icon to

652c8552-e290-4f89-b176-9721bfd6af5a-2
00:17:38.014 --> 00:17:38.600
save it.

86f35918-ec2f-4a90-825a-52c6d50d3cd6-0
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.920
And there are tools here.

2511fc56-1e64-41f9-9e0f-c4d64bd6724c-0
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.800
It would show you how to site it,
share it, download it.

c80ad8f9-aac0-4d11-9391-166862c233a1-0
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.315
So let's just click on site because this
is useful for you for when you are doing

c80ad8f9-aac0-4d11-9391-166862c233a1-1
00:17:50.315 --> 00:17:51.360
your referencing.

14abc30a-7eb3-466e-b4cb-1b88bd21702c-0
00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.280
You can see here you would select the
style.

d1983246-a375-4bfe-8db3-eb959f760d91-0
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.720
So we want Harvard.

c44eacdf-aac0-47d1-9ac2-7d33329958f8-0
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.718
And then it gives you this citation and
you can copy that and then paste that

c44eacdf-aac0-47d1-9ac2-7d33329958f8-1
00:18:04.718 --> 00:18:08.413
into your document,
into your Word document for your

c44eacdf-aac0-47d1-9ac2-7d33329958f8-2
00:18:08.413 --> 00:18:09.320
bibliography.

f3c857fc-fc7a-4afc-b9c4-58eb5aebdfa2-0
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.280
So that's something very useful for you.

00ce89f4-2cb6-4127-8985-d93f2f0889fa-0
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.583
Obviously only for the articles that are
already referenced in the body of your

00ce89f4-2cb6-4127-8985-d93f2f0889fa-1
00:18:18.583 --> 00:18:19.160
answer.

1fe446f9-7983-4f25-ad36-f6476eb66ab5-0
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:24.825
Don't just randomly copy references and
stick them into your bibliography just to

1fe446f9-7983-4f25-ad36-f6476eb66ab5-1
00:18:24.825 --> 00:18:26.280
make up a bibliography.

00316f78-2cb2-47ee-a897-088b3b3b16f4-0
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:32.183
Only use ones that have been included in
your actual answer,

00316f78-2cb2-47ee-a897-088b3b3b16f4-1
00:18:32.183 --> 00:18:37.440
but this can be a way to help you then do
your referencing.

6acb3d8f-7477-466b-ab03-963cbd78de22-0
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:43.045
OK, so let me just show you that again,
if you use this this article,

6acb3d8f-7477-466b-ab03-963cbd78de22-1
00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:49.330
you would click here and say site and it
would give you the information you would

6acb3d8f-7477-466b-ab03-963cbd78de22-2
00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.240
choose the correct style,
which for us is Harvard.

e736ff26-0f27-4343-bbeb-72869216b364-0
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.520
So it should change it,
which it's not right now did earlier.

05bec848-2c38-497d-95d0-ad10641899f4-0
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.760
So I'm not sure why it is not changing
right now.

a1278736-80a4-4604-acd2-f7fd1178cef2-0
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.440
It could just be the network.

c96c56e0-13fb-4e75-b21d-04c1d26b81c3-0
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Let's just see.

46d0b479-c908-4bfe-9f0c-21c219996154-0
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.960
OK, so now it's changing.

fa5a2ab1-c495-4ca0-82bb-17e078a69ec9-0
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.240
Let's see Harvard again.

f48a7035-28f6-4499-8f67-c7d2446f1f56-0
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:13.960
There we go.

3b7a8089-3741-4df1-ae61-0f3edaae638c-0
00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.320
And you could copy to clipboard or you
could highlight and copy it.

b165de5e-86a9-4cf7-b60c-cfd6ef7e4db5-0
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.882
OK,
so that is basically how to use the

b165de5e-86a9-4cf7-b60c-cfd6ef7e4db5-1
00:19:23.882 --> 00:19:24.720
database.

89515b05-cfa7-4f91-9761-4ae23ee11645-0
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.520
Again, you could look for other.

9892bd3b-2588-42cd-85fe-da8a913048d0-0
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:38.004
Let's say we wanted to look at
metaphysics, Metaphysics,

9892bd3b-2588-42cd-85fe-da8a913048d0-1
00:19:38.004 --> 00:19:40.480
we could search for that.

bf5dfdc7-21d5-4c54-9999-4204a65b43f4-0
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.880
Then you see we get almost 20,000 results.

95111cb6-3aa3-4e3a-92b2-ea1b0ecebb90-0
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.581
So here you might want to narrow down
your search because that is a lot of

95111cb6-3aa3-4e3a-92b2-ea1b0ecebb90-1
00:19:51.581 --> 00:19:53.160
results to go through.

3f72db07-0bbe-47a3-8f63-6201c866606f-0
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:54.520
OK.

0d436e89-11e8-4dc7-8cbb-29dc81fccc07-0
00:19:54.520 --> 00:20:00.680
But again, you can see academic journals,
so you know, this is good information.

64d5506d-701a-4bee-9c94-42e34c969f66-0
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.520
OK,
so I won't go through all of this again.

e6289117-0df2-4f00-9f46-90d2339d177d-0
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.200
Again,
PDF online full text you can instead of.

52243d7f-d138-4fd1-8006-259124910db4-0
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.725
If you don't want to open the all the
detailed information,

52243d7f-d138-4fd1-8006-259124910db4-1
00:20:12.725 --> 00:20:18.080
you can just click on Access now and it
will open the PDF immediately.

a6ce62d6-a29a-4ad4-9ca0-bdb905f23f2a-0
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.160
Hey, and there we have the PDF.

18748d57-c304-422f-84c8-60ca03d9dbf0-0
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:31.160
We can see this is not in English or it's
in two more than one language.

d35da408-31cd-457f-8485-fb01236f5c93-0
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.000
So the while the abstract at least is in
English and another language.

43a29e18-c989-436b-9ce5-5af6d81ea7a5-0
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.760
So this might become difficult.

4e6f83a1-7e34-41f9-ac7f-332b17814e81-0
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.999
So this might not be an article that you
want,

4e6f83a1-7e34-41f9-ac7f-332b17814e81-1
00:20:39.999 --> 00:20:42.000
but just so that you can see how it works.

7c2e5e60-5fc4-47f2-91b6-eac3d64254ec-0
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.360
And then we can go back to our search.

6410cf52-c011-4579-bb1f-4a771186bf9a-0
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:52.710
So something else I just want to show you
is if you use Google Scholar,

6410cf52-c011-4579-bb1f-4a771186bf9a-1
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:59.168
because Google Scholar is obviously also
a very useful and reliable search engine

6410cf52-c011-4579-bb1f-4a771186bf9a-2
00:20:59.168 --> 00:21:02.240
because it gives you academic articles.

dc538911-84f2-4ad1-9ecb-43b70c0635e9-0
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.120
So we'll end book chapters.

e3d745e4-b437-4804-ba1e-eec9f9f600fd-0
00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.640
So we'll go here to Google Scholar.

29c65c8b-1391-4cea-8fa5-f41728159f5c-0
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:13.693
So I have gone to Google Scholar by
typing Google Scholar into my Google

29c65c8b-1391-4cea-8fa5-f41728159f5c-1
00:21:13.693 --> 00:21:14.640
search engine.

9f710f3c-1641-4136-9cee-c7fcdb246136-0
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.960
You can get to it however you want to.

d64cadb2-6ece-41a3-b9fe-7e836ebbbddb-0
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.995
For the purposes of the video,
I've already done a search for South

d64cadb2-6ece-41a3-b9fe-7e836ebbbddb-1
00:21:21.995 --> 00:21:23.000
African philosophy.

fbdd62e2-f961-4cc2-817a-5fc4ec4d9a20-0
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:29.676
You will see that for a lot of them,
it will open either an HTML or it will

fbdd62e2-f961-4cc2-817a-5fc4ec4d9a20-1
00:21:29.676 --> 00:21:31.000
give you the PDF.

f8f7e709-951b-40f1-9453-052ac320912f-0
00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.280
So that's very useful because then you
can get those articles.

893a0f9e-bda0-45f6-8817-b84cc048111a-0
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.651
Sometimes, however, you will see,
for example, here, it's a book,

893a0f9e-bda0-45f6-8817-b84cc048111a-1
00:21:39.651 --> 00:21:41.800
an introduction to African philosophy.

15f7502f-cbd0-4bd3-92f8-03f05ca8b911-0
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.335
It's not going to give you a PDF or take
you to another page where you can access

15f7502f-cbd0-4bd3-92f8-03f05ca8b911-1
00:21:47.335 --> 00:21:49.040
the article or the chapter.

c69594af-6163-4b71-bffb-09d6b10cbe35-0
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:57.527
So what you can do then is, for example,
let's open this because we can see that

c69594af-6163-4b71-bffb-09d6b10cbe35-1
00:21:57.527 --> 00:22:03.040
it doesn't have an attached PDF or option
to open the chapter.

93f24293-1829-4385-b101-6edbe6006b92-0
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.880
We can see that it's a chapter.

1a8c01eb-a2e5-40df-8bf3-1838f88061fa-0
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.640
We can see the pages.

d77d3a0e-761f-418f-bebc-6246ca596ef0-0
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.280
We can see it's in this book.

8aeabbee-b07d-4bd1-82a3-a1efd843c886-0
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.722
Methods,
Substance and the Future of African

8aeabbee-b07d-4bd1-82a3-a1efd843c886-1
00:22:11.722 --> 00:22:12.320
Philosophy.

fd54d952-d358-49a9-aeb7-b56d5a49f4bf-0
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.455
There are ways to access the chapter via
your institution,

fd54d952-d358-49a9-aeb7-b56d5a49f4bf-1
00:22:17.455 --> 00:22:21.240
but often we aren't able to access it
from this page.

8645ec69-35d2-487f-96b7-12eb26c6f246-0
00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.920
At times you can, but not always.

be02e3fe-ee25-475f-bcd1-dfda733314c3-0
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:31.089
And you can see if you want to buy the
book as AE publication or APDF,

be02e3fe-ee25-475f-bcd1-dfda733314c3-1
00:22:31.089 --> 00:22:37.084
you're going to have to pay €13 or
subscribe to the journal for €32.

be02e3fe-ee25-475f-bcd1-dfda733314c3-2
00:22:37.084 --> 00:22:38.040
00 a month.

49284377-08f2-41d6-a495-78a89578ed63-0
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.720
So that's a very expensive.

0fcf57c0-f04f-48ac-9992-7286ad689f9c-0
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:47.797
So we obviously don't want to do that
because we have the accessibility through

0fcf57c0-f04f-48ac-9992-7286ad689f9c-1
00:22:47.797 --> 00:22:49.200
the university.

0f8e7269-6568-496c-b4c9-26807e9bac1e-0
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.760
So we're going to copy this title.

6eb34637-41f9-4f12-963f-bbd5507527de-0
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:58.400
So I've highlighted it and said control C
or you can say right click and say copy.

5f3579fc-158c-4380-87fb-47a00c6e75f4-0
00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.560
And then what I'm going to do is go back
to the library page.

f40493cd-56f5-47de-8f2d-47939d485f22-0
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.720
So this remember where we started on the
library page.

dd149a3a-6b00-4a54-9541-1d89b3debd6c-0
00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.560
So we're back on the library page here.

22aa8089-21a0-4c21-9f76-6a3794b6656a-0
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:17.577
Now in search Unisa Resources,
we are going to paste this title of the

22aa8089-21a0-4c21-9f76-6a3794b6656a-1
00:23:17.577 --> 00:23:20.120
chapter and see what comes up.

592fe18c-8def-4e76-9a8e-87eedf69e272-0
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.352
Now as a note,
you're not always going to have access to

592fe18c-8def-4e76-9a8e-87eedf69e272-1
00:23:24.352 --> 00:23:25.000
everything.

66f2644e-6401-44ee-a19f-05dd89ac5236-0
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.960
Unisa does not have access to every
single journal.

9f680f4b-e954-4f2b-94f9-017cb28446ca-0
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.640
Not every book is available as a free
ebook or a free chapter.

e22a263b-93ed-4a1a-9cdd-589f568c6371-0
00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.680
So you're not going to be able to access
everything, unfortunately.

75e0e526-1c25-4b01-98d9-664349121d1d-0
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:42.973
But there are enough resources,
more than enough that you will never get

75e0e526-1c25-4b01-98d9-664349121d1d-1
00:23:42.973 --> 00:23:46.880
through all of them,
that are useful for your purposes.

b238b855-4e2f-4d54-b6ce-783c1e8a480d-0
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.720
So we put it there and we say search and
we'll see what comes up.

9d1502b8-bc1a-448b-87fa-d6844cfc29f9-0
00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:02.346
So we just got to wait for the page to
load and here we can see that this book

9d1502b8-bc1a-448b-87fa-d6844cfc29f9-1
00:24:02.346 --> 00:24:03.120
comes up.

fa37766a-0b53-48b2-917c-5f1d0a95d69a-0
00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.814
So remember,
this is the title of the book that the

fa37766a-0b53-48b2-917c-5f1d0a95d69a-1
00:24:06.814 --> 00:24:07.880
chapter was in.

c901e019-7acc-4b27-907f-90aed127acd0-0
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.244
And we can see that if there's a full
text online or it's available at the

c901e019-7acc-4b27-907f-90aed127acd0-1
00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:19.101
library as a hard copy,
you can see other books come up that are

c901e019-7acc-4b27-907f-90aed127acd0-2
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:22.240
perhaps similar in the topics are similar.

8a94bc04-eda4-46c2-87aa-5190380d7160-0
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.989
Again, full text online,
which we're very fortunate to be able to

8a94bc04-eda4-46c2-87aa-5190380d7160-1
00:24:26.989 --> 00:24:29.360
have these full text available to us.

9def69f6-184f-4e16-ab0a-3d870de54b8b-0
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.258
So we're going to here,
we see we've got the book here,

9def69f6-184f-4e16-ab0a-3d870de54b8b-1
00:24:34.258 --> 00:24:37.880
so we're going to click on the ebook and
we'll say full text online.

e5e78880-69fe-4e1b-a2eb-eb5f53df0164-0
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:43.400
It again opens a new tab,
so we'll let that load.

7c681b5e-d186-4ec0-9314-5de879c23ff2-0
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.280
It now wants me to log in because we're
using the library site.

472d13a7-b95f-4ca4-956e-ad8030ee8d3e-0
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:54.182
So they are putting my information and
it's now going to transfer us and we'll

472d13a7-b95f-4ca4-956e-ad8030ee8d3e-1
00:24:54.182 --> 00:24:56.800
see what comes up when it opens.

d53edcf3-7c3a-4eda-ae5f-664e0d242a93-0
00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:04.400
So we can see now that it has opened the
ebook.

4f3707bf-b66f-44a6-9a48-429a7a3cb34d-0
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.172
So you can access the ebook or you can
download, but take note here,

4f3707bf-b66f-44a6-9a48-429a7a3cb34d-1
00:25:11.172 --> 00:25:14.840
you can only download 15 pages at a time.

65805ba0-e5e2-4259-8619-13192eeb59e4-0
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.800
So you cannot download the whole ebook.

22fb77fa-a5a9-4d9a-90ac-e63f810e451d-0
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.493
You also can't copy and paste from the
book,

22fb77fa-a5a9-4d9a-90ac-e63f810e451d-1
00:25:22.493 --> 00:25:29.360
but you can download 15 pages of the book
at a time if you wanted to.

8ca30f55-685b-4f9d-941a-cd105bd12903-0
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.280
So we can either access the ebook now.

dc594bb7-e038-4b13-8e0e-09d5a4089073-0
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.600
So let's click on that so you can see
what happens then.

f8788867-c67c-4b0b-bf96-0f0373d31630-0
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.120
We've just got to give it a little bit of
time.

6eb83b33-bd6f-49b9-b376-6ab043daf8c3-0
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.640
We'll just close that so you can see
better.

daaf3f09-7787-4ebe-a1bb-2c7fd4b8d73b-0
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.262
OK,
so here we now have we'll close that as

daaf3f09-7787-4ebe-a1bb-2c7fd4b8d73b-1
00:25:55.262 --> 00:25:55.560
well.

f36d9c27-0c17-4aaf-a7fb-9092891f9997-0
00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:02.323
We now have the whole ebook,
so you would be able to read it online

f36d9c27-0c17-4aaf-a7fb-9092891f9997-1
00:26:02.323 --> 00:26:04.960
here on the right hand side.

72c0a5ad-b861-422d-ad41-2c46f5589c66-0
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.640
Here we have the table of contents.

7cdf834b-4dc2-4e7c-a564-2217792090c2-0
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.000
So it's easy for you to navigate through
the book.

64eb11d6-9f6d-4a13-a5e9-df4b8cbe3d27-0
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.560
So we don't want to look at everything.

b2ddd1d7-4f5f-4601-bf1d-c4840b608bce-0
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.844
We want to look at this,
the particular chapter that we found

b2ddd1d7-4f5f-4601-bf1d-c4840b608bce-1
00:26:16.844 --> 00:26:21.211
about the state of African philosophy,
which you would have to look,

b2ddd1d7-4f5f-4601-bf1d-c4840b608bce-2
00:26:21.211 --> 00:26:24.440
navigate through the table of contents to
find it.

4bd3e68c-618e-46ec-b2b0-0d93ef7e43e6-0
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.800
However, I know that I've already looked,
so I know it's Chapter 5.

51e8a3c7-0421-42d2-9bd4-cc7e16e8971f-0
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.157
Otherwise,
you could go through this contents page,

51e8a3c7-0421-42d2-9bd4-cc7e16e8971f-1
00:26:34.157 --> 00:26:34.440
see.

a3b53682-48e4-4a5c-b23c-0fc86053f694-0
00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.760
OK, it's in Chapter 5.

8b181823-31ab-4e1c-98b5-be20abb5a9e3-0
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.440
So that's where we want to go in Part 1.

a3963a54-a372-403f-8319-40ab689df998-0
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:45.670
So we go there and we click on Chapter 5
and then again you are able to navigate

a3963a54-a372-403f-8319-40ab689df998-1
00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:49.920
through the chapter itself on the right
hand side.

a6855a61-a27d-4d55-9b46-d423144d310f-0
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.993
You can download if you click on this
little icon here,

a6855a61-a27d-4d55-9b46-d423144d310f-1
00:26:54.993 --> 00:26:56.960
you could download the chapter.

2db1ba1d-a568-4ba2-83c7-6b853253155a-0
00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.480
But again,
remember only 15 pages at a time.

4e41b0cd-ad87-4992-a62d-2c7237618bd7-0
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.724
So perhaps there's a particular part of
the chapter,

4e41b0cd-ad87-4992-a62d-2c7237618bd7-1
00:27:03.724 --> 00:27:07.520
a particular section of the chapter that
is important to you.

7deba51a-83e9-43b9-af5f-28710a7fda25-0
00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:14.648
You could download that, but otherwise,
you can read it online, you can save it,

7deba51a-83e9-43b9-af5f-28710a7fda25-1
00:27:14.648 --> 00:27:18.960
you can share it so that you can find it
easily.

1fc1743d-78a0-4ad3-8e89-03f6cf7f666d-0
00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.640
So there are options for you to make it
easier.

d31704f0-110a-4868-9d62-eb7d33b6f028-0
00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.680
So here we see, we've got the chapter.

3336a95b-4275-49a2-a7bb-16e5b3e4d273-0
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:29.082
We would be able to read it if we wanted
to just look at the conclusion,

3336a95b-4275-49a2-a7bb-16e5b3e4d273-1
00:27:29.082 --> 00:27:32.219
for example,
we could navigate there and then we could

3336a95b-4275-49a2-a7bb-16e5b3e4d273-2
00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:33.360
read the conclusion.

f0e1a4c4-3e33-4f71-82f2-4458967b7b0c-0
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:39.767
So that is another way that you can
access resources that you might find on

f0e1a4c4-3e33-4f71-82f2-4458967b7b0c-1
00:27:39.767 --> 00:27:45.040
Google Scholar that are not available
immediately on Google Scholar.

d0c27590-18bc-402c-bbc5-d5a06d61554b-0
00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.520
So sometimes you will also find it with
articles.

2dd77126-7a33-4122-ad92-6a5c940cbb01-0
00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.994
Generally these days,
most articles are available on Google

2dd77126-7a33-4122-ad92-6a5c940cbb01-1
00:27:53.994 --> 00:27:58.000
Scholar as a PDF or through another HTML
page.

7e73ee52-c1fc-4f03-a313-dfe9ce019662-0
00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.120
But sometimes you will find articles or
book chapters that aren't available there.

a204a2b4-6afb-42f7-bfc9-1c01b8dbff26-0
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:09.481
And then like I showed you, you can go to,
let me just show you again,

a204a2b4-6afb-42f7-bfc9-1c01b8dbff26-1
00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:15.000
you can search the UNICER resources to
try and find them there.

560b79cc-94c4-4359-8988-66a9ed999f71-0
00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.000
So let's just look at one more example
and see if that works.

e904851f-a2b3-44e1-bd5c-578538b6531f-0
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:26.360
So let's go back to we had,
we searched for South African philosophy.

8cb250ec-3139-48e3-a7f0-505b3271e4b8-0
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.200
So let's see, you see,
all of these are available as PDFs.

0cf3c211-0148-4f59-a77b-61b4c55cc15c-0
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.880
So you could open those.

2b244ce1-685d-4ebd-beaf-dd1f07741f34-0
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.960
So let's just see if this is available.

b5ed9072-454d-492d-894d-3d6fa62d05e9-0
00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:44.295
You see now it might not be,
but we'll copy it and paste and see if it

b5ed9072-454d-492d-894d-3d6fa62d05e9-1
00:28:44.295 --> 00:28:46.400
is available through UNIOSA.

c0ed4c93-3ace-41a5-a435-2d4778567789-0
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:57.570
So we'll search and we'll wait for the
options.

f7ba0dbf-6d42-43b1-bff6-bdc49a3a3d63-0
00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.767
So again,
we're lucky here that this one is

f7ba0dbf-6d42-43b1-bff6-bdc49a3a3d63-1
00:29:00.767 --> 00:29:02.890
available as a full text online.

2eb4b955-98b1-48ae-9652-7fc4d919a1a9-0
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.970
So we can click there full text online.

7abd8038-b144-4de2-aaab-3c2d9bc580c7-0
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:07.690
It takes us to the new tab.

e2dbb855-d4a2-414d-afb1-c22e1083fc3c-0
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:20.823
We'll give it a little bit of time to
open and again here we can see the

e2dbb855-d4a2-414d-afb1-c22e1083fc3c-1
00:29:20.823 --> 00:29:24.640
information for the book.

fed74d8a-1c5c-44e9-9abe-0dd79e03f64e-0
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:31.080
We can open it as AE publication or a PDF
full text.

cd69a7cc-3770-4720-b15a-935105734767-0
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.720
So let's open the PDF for now.

7d9e0913-ba5f-4f72-b17a-5b714bb01dba-0
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.520
OK, we'll give it a little bit of time.

4282835b-d9f4-4fe2-ae6b-63334b9aaccf-0
00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.510
But again,
here on the right hand side you can see

4282835b-d9f4-4fe2-ae6b-63334b9aaccf-1
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:50.600
the you can navigate through the chapters.

d5999514-f4b7-45cf-a94f-474f3bfe1a2a-0
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.005
So let's say for example,
we wanted to just look at foundations of

d5999514-f4b7-45cf-a94f-474f3bfe1a2a-1
00:29:55.005 --> 00:29:56.560
modern African philosophy.

af9e97ae-680b-488b-bda4-6d967d1c0294-0
00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.640
We could come to that page,
we could click on the icon to download it.

ac2696a1-c463-4d72-a4dd-77b25e9b084b-0
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.440
We'll see.

ec209034-b0c2-4d79-a66e-384830d30d51-0
00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.045
Once you've clicked on the icon to
download,

ec209034-b0c2-4d79-a66e-384830d30d51-1
00:30:06.045 --> 00:30:10.640
it tells you that the number of pages
available to download is 60.

d849460b-92b8-4d52-827a-077aa53b26c5-0
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.495
But you can see here that because chapter
2 is only 14 pages,

d849460b-92b8-4d52-827a-077aa53b26c5-1
00:30:15.495 --> 00:30:20.647
you can download the whole chapter,
which is fantastic if that is what you're

d849460b-92b8-4d52-827a-077aa53b26c5-2
00:30:20.647 --> 00:30:21.440
looking for.

0279949e-85bd-4274-b340-a878de9caa94-0
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:30.264
So then you would just click download
again, you'd give it a little bit of time,

0279949e-85bd-4274-b340-a878de9caa94-1
00:30:30.264 --> 00:30:34.840
and then you could save it to your device.

55e8f83e-ab3e-4608-b8de-512aa1bf77fc-0
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.848
So I won't save that,
but that's another way that you can

55e8f83e-ab3e-4608-b8de-512aa1bf77fc-1
00:30:38.848 --> 00:30:41.880
access resources that are useful for your
studies.

9e431d5c-dac3-47a2-a970-cc55e4eb1a91-0
00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:48.811
So I hope that this video has helped you
to understand how to use the databases

9e431d5c-dac3-47a2-a970-cc55e4eb1a91-1
00:30:48.811 --> 00:30:55.024
and how to use Google Scholar as very
important resources for your studies and

9e431d5c-dac3-47a2-a970-cc55e4eb1a91-2
00:30:55.024 --> 00:30:58.800
for accessing information for your
assessments.

f1947c09-953a-4151-8cae-03bdd7e864f1-0
00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:03.560
And again, remember that these are good,
credible academic sources.

35f8c416-6176-4a6a-948d-26f727dd525a-0
00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:09.884
So please rely on these rather than
relying on sources like Wikipedia, blogs,

35f8c416-6176-4a6a-948d-26f727dd525a-1
00:31:09.884 --> 00:31:15.560
videos that we don't know if they're
reliable, credible and accurate.

9b9fcb4e-77d5-451f-af83-a3ccc1359326-0
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:21.276
If you have any questions,
please feel free to e-mail me or send me

9b9fcb4e-77d5-451f-af83-a3ccc1359326-1
00:31:21.276 --> 00:31:22.880
a message on my Unisa.

55b2e1ef-823a-49c4-8199-9a85c95d7fc9-0
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.749
And remember,
if you need any assistance accessing the

55b2e1ef-823a-49c4-8199-9a85c95d7fc9-1
00:31:26.749 --> 00:31:31.480
databases or using the library site,
please get in touch with the library.

13c7a5bf-08df-4b97-9535-ed7a068f86e6-0
00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.305
And please look through all of those
resources that are provided by the

13c7a5bf-08df-4b97-9535-ed7a068f86e6-1
00:31:35.305 --> 00:31:39.396
library as they will really make a
difference to your academic career and to

13c7a5bf-08df-4b97-9535-ed7a068f86e6-2
00:31:39.396 --> 00:31:41.840
helping you be successful through
university.
